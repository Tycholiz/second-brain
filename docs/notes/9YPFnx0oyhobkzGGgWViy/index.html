<p>Unsure what to include in your resume? Use the simple ‘Diver Test’
Use the ‘Diver Test’ to optimize your resume for any job</p>
<p>One slow Wednesday afternoon I found myself in the office communal kitchen with a coworker whom I didn’t know very well. Eager to nudge the hour hand towards 5:00, we struck up a conversation. It turned out that Brent was the hiring manager for the department, and he was feeling accomplished because he had just brought on the newest addition to his team. Not only this, but he told me that he had never been so impressed with a candidate in his entire life!
Naturally, I assumed that he must have had an impressive background. So I asked what company he worked for.
“I don’t remember”, he casually replied.
Baffled, I asked what product he sold at his previous job.
“He didn’t” was his response.
“What do you mean?”
“He’s never sold a product in his life”
So, I asked, “why did you hire him then?”
“Because he was so brilliant at selling himself”
I’m sure my curiosity could be read quite easily, and had to know: why was this man so impressive, and where did he learn to sell so well if he’s never even had a sales job?
“He used to be a diver,” Brent interjected, responding to my obviously confused expression. “And that fact alone did not impress me. What did impress me so much was how he was able to tie diving and sales together.
“I’d love to hear this” I replied, and let Brent explain the interview.
“When he came in, we sat down and his body language immediately showed he was comfortable. This is the first thing I look for in all candidates. Nervousness is natural and ok, but there has to be some level of comfort that can be grown into. “
Check #1.
“After some back and forth, we went through his resume, including his most recent profession in diving, which he had done for the past 10 years. I asked him, ‘Why the switch from diving to sales? Why do you think you’ll make a strong salesman?’”.
“His response blew me away, because he explained that being a diver taught him how to manage his time effectively. He went on to describe how as a diver, you have a limited amount of oxygen. This means you must always be aware of your progress in relation to how much time is left. If you are not on track to meet your goal, you must make adjustments on the fly. Failure to meet those goals is not an option, because it greatly reduces your efficiency and will end up costing the company money.”
This response stunned me, because it completely opened my mind to how efficient humans can be, and how skills, competencies and knowledge gained are different for everyone, even given the same experiences as someone else.
He continued on.
“Next, he described how while underwater, it is vital to be able to work with co-workers to complete tasks within small windows of opportunity. He said, ‘I have learned how to truly depend on my co-workers. This has led to me becoming an incredibly team-focused individual.’”
“After that point, he continued to express how through diving, he has learned to remain calm in the face of adversity, and how to face your fears to push your own man-made boundaries.”
Suffice to say, the man was hired, and for good reason.
Experience is not everything. What is everything, is what is gained from those experiences.
A less observant diver perhaps would have seen himself as merely a specialist that has chosen an immutable career. He too would have learned teamwork and the ability to manage time, but it may have been limited to his job. He might not have believed in himself enough to apply those competencies to other areas of his life. Even if he did apply those things, his lack of awareness would have limited his ability to sell himself, and in effect limit the impact his abilities could have had on his life.
The Diver Test is a simple way to apply many of the varied experiences that you have had throughout your life to a new scenario. Every single person has experiences, and with those experiences come lessons. The mistake would be to limit those lessons to the medium through which they were learned. Instead, expand what you know, by leveraging what you have already learned in your life.
So ask yourself next time you are adding something to your resume: does it pass The Diver Test?</p></div></div><div style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px" class="ant-col ant-col-xs-0 ant-col-md-6"><div><div class=""><div class="ant-anchor-wrapper dendron-toc" style="max-height:calc(100vh - 64px);z-index:1"><div class="ant-anchor"><div class="ant-anchor-ink"><span class="ant-anchor-ink-ball"></span></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#selling-without-being-recognized" title="Selling without being recognized">Selling without being recognized</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#start-off-by-making-a-connection---the-earlier-this-is-done-the-stronger-communication-will-be" title="Start off by making a connection. - The earlier this is done, the stronger communication will be.">Start off by making a connection. - The earlier this is done, the stronger communication will be.</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#start-with-the-problem" title="Start with the problem">Start with the problem</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#selling-psychology" title="Selling Psychology">Selling Psychology</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#techniques" title="Techniques">Techniques</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#phone" title="Phone">Phone</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#raise-expectations-lower-expectations-overdeliver" title="Raise expectations, lower expectations, overdeliver">Raise expectations, lower expectations, overdeliver</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#fable-the-diver-test" title="Fable: The Diver Test">Fable: The Diver Test</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ant-divider ant-divider-horizontal" role="separator"></div><footer class="ant-layout-footer" style="padding:0 24px 24px"></footer></main></section></section></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"note":{"id":"9YPFnx0oyhobkzGGgWViy","title":"Sales","desc":"","updated":1688754279306,"created":1616818199847,"custom":{},"fname":"business.sales","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"../main/thoughts-on","name":"thoughts-on"},"contentHash":"01d80fc1c32e2513a44922881297623c","links":[],"anchors":{"selling-without-being-recognized":{"type":"header","text":"Selling without being recognized","value":"selling-without-being-recognized","line":8,"column":0,"depth":3},"start-off-by-making-a-connection---the-earlier-this-is-done-the-stronger-communication-will-be":{"type":"header","text":"Start off by making a connection. - The earlier this is done, the stronger communication will be.","value":"start-off-by-making-a-connection---the-earlier-this-is-done-the-stronger-communication-will-be","line":12,"column":0,"depth":3},"start-with-the-problem":{"type":"header","text":"Start with the problem","value":"start-with-the-problem","line":18,"column":0,"depth":3},"selling-psychology":{"type":"header","text":"Selling Psychology","value":"selling-psychology","line":21,"column":0,"depth":3},"techniques":{"type":"header","text":"Techniques","value":"techniques","line":35,"column":0,"depth":1},"phone":{"type":"header","text":"Phone","value":"phone","line":36,"column":0,"depth":3},"raise-expectations-lower-expectations-overdeliver":{"type":"header","text":"Raise expectations, lower expectations, overdeliver","value":"raise-expectations-lower-expectations-overdeliver","line":41,"column":0,"depth":3},"fable-the-diver-test":{"type":"header","text":"Fable: The Diver Test","value":"fable-the-diver-test","line":44,"column":0,"depth":3}},"children":[],"parent":"U4tQLU5tRHqr9e7H3G4Gm","data":{}},"body":"\u003ch1 id=\"sales\"\u003eSales\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#sales\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"selling-without-being-recognized\"\u003eSelling without being recognized\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#selling-without-being-recognized\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou have to sell it in a way that explains the facts (that everyone can agree on), then come to a conclusion that people will reach naturally.

Hopefully, when the interview comes, you can outperform the expectations that you set out. \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"fable-the-diver-test\"\u003eFable: The Diver Test\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#fable-the-diver-test\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnsure what to include in your resume? Use the simple ‘Diver Test’\nUse the ‘Diver Test’ to optimize your resume for any job\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne slow Wednesday afternoon I found myself in the office communal kitchen with a coworker whom I didn’t know very well. Eager to nudge the hour hand towards 5:00, we struck up a conversation. It turned out that Brent was the hiring manager for the department, and he was feeling accomplished because he had just brought on the newest addition to his team. Not only this, but he told me that he had never been so impressed with a candidate in his entire life!\nNaturally, I assumed that he must have had an impressive background. So I asked what company he worked for.\n“I don’t remember”, he casually replied.\nBaffled, I asked what product he sold at his previous job.\n“He didn’t” was his response.\n“What do you mean?”\n“He’s never sold a product in his life”\nSo, I asked, “why did you hire him then?”\n“Because he was so brilliant at selling himself”\nI’m sure my curiosity could be read quite easily, and had to know: why was this man so impressive, and where did he learn to sell so well if he’s never even had a sales job?\n“He used to be a diver,” Brent interjected, responding to my obviously confused expression. “And that fact alone did not impress me. What did impress me so much was how he was able to tie diving and sales together.\n“I’d love to hear this” I replied, and let Brent explain the interview.\n“When he came in, we sat down and his body language immediately showed he was comfortable. This is the first thing I look for in all candidates. Nervousness is natural and ok, but there has to be some level of comfort that can be grown into. “\nCheck #1.\n“After some back and forth, we went through his resume, including his most recent profession in diving, which he had done for the past 10 years. I asked him, ‘Why the switch from diving to sales? Why do you think you’ll make a strong salesman?’”.\n“His response blew me away, because he explained that being a diver taught him how to manage his time effectively. He went on to describe how as a diver, you have a limited amount of oxygen. This means you must always be aware of your progress in relation to how much time is left. If you are not on track to meet your goal, you must make adjustments on the fly. Failure to meet those goals is not an option, because it greatly reduces your efficiency and will end up costing the company money.”\nThis response stunned me, because it completely opened my mind to how efficient humans can be, and how skills, competencies and knowledge gained are different for everyone, even given the same experiences as someone else.\nHe continued on.\n“Next, he described how while underwater, it is vital to be able to work with co-workers to complete tasks within small windows of opportunity. He said, ‘I have learned how to truly depend on my co-workers. This has led to me becoming an incredibly team-focused individual.’”\n“After that point, he continued to express how through diving, he has learned to remain calm in the face of adversity, and how to face your fears to push your own man-made boundaries.”\nSuffice to say, the man was hired, and for good reason.\nExperience is not everything. What is everything, is what is gained from those experiences.\nA less observant diver perhaps would have seen himself as merely a specialist that has chosen an immutable career. He too would have learned teamwork and the ability to manage time, but it may have been limited to his job. He might not have believed in himself enough to apply those competencies to other areas of his life. Even if he did apply those things, his lack of awareness would have limited his ability to sell himself, and in effect limit the impact his abilities could have had on his life.\nThe Diver Test is a simple way to apply many of the varied experiences that you have had throughout your life to a new scenario. Every single person has experiences, and with those experiences come lessons. The mistake would be to limit those lessons to the medium through which they were learned. Instead, expand what you know, by leveraging what you have already learned in your life.\nSo ask yourself next time you are adding something to your resume: does it pass The Diver Test?\u003c/p\u003e","noteIndex":{"id":"8qvi4S0Dk1BAaCLhfHqAp","title":"Second Brain","desc":"","updated":1672111562730,"created":1616360437888,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"../main/thoughts-on","name":"thoughts-on"},"contentHash":"dd394dade3f08feaa5cf4d1caeb1c991","links":[],"anchors":{"tags":{"type":"header","text":"Tags","value":"tags","line":12,"column":0,"depth":3}},"children":["8aPvLrwcPnxcTwx7PdvXW","l9ldUruxqRBZwMij5KlS5","xWh3SS0J1hvRSZ7g4LvEE","cc5kdn5ay8omhcud9hjfpyk","9jNuGCXVuFaZOGZfLpKi5","mhlpKRrfT0qlXzTaapFYZ","QU1tbQ4KX64UBCWtCxAcR","U4tQLU5tRHqr9e7H3G4Gm","PvcIkEJcDtcv7luF2mBIU","2wW5Kxk794H9mfnu9VPA8","iwANjkbi3nbIovlVpepWm","XYgvsgvjzgoyvY6KAEu5Y","pT9wnWnS42pFId9UIH5he","gmXZ6Xy8f8FFQ66Z5DYqh","CjV6QXVHIqQTuZTSlSSlB","IgbLitAU1k0ioGhuvmjjS","D42jFbx0vNlT7S6QRb5ee","dFs5zopMmrh3rPgQaSkyP","W0AgEfoTzJ8VxVE4QqhSL","ggU4P3K1OhUlHBJbpgHiD","vtu2srTzCfoNUHv0Xcbxn","6kuwlrc3PT5JoQS9xZWZW","qoZ6e9KsYPestYFpO4Ce4","GPH8BieqB4dtqul80gJvX","MbW1wF5mIZ7g3DPXrOSyZ","Ay9vOAmvV8ODJFpaEkw6J","8Pi3wPs4LTxlAEOUE48Te","SDd8268l79j2cnvCVVl8F","zI5rK8mFkNghzLgbQD6ox","zCwMY5ckgKAqstOhw2Drd","i5Fya3Vzzm0rBT0ctByuo","YDbL8QXchj03NvTIZOdrk","km4fy13hx9puopyjr1ajdgj","WdAyuDkIi16pl1pnaopzx","15ax6k6x106sotobkyn3jqp","sgu2QxqDGup93hJPx8RJd","mT663nw5DUEaEGzXI98yD","Dyg6bFtxE0UkB7gz6pqzq","cn1x9vhdapyt1fvgtvfekea","0aYhvzCfaIxLaNhqNCV9Q","q9NskCGxFGNQwBDcsgNkY","wAdoBPUMHEFJkm6XVlHXW","sCYBuXnSNA259MDwhakmv","YgQusR9D6RbBgdkLuJuDh","ovHaNSb3tnl2LTdV7wwau","eqklm05q2g46ikqaqv9ijh9","8TJC5FfwKtfmH4GfOZVoO","9rKIOn3BV7ZU1FFlJxmvC","rsrE9vBXK0ehNkbEjltlZ","XTkKLi0Jg1imZ2lbhgOrv","4Fuw6OHQ5uhEVCUfXDfkb","pUEyedPYYlNSVLuiUSnge","KtoCw0HFEddGJ7GuW7GnN","BoxZ36iWEbUoRProxPo4D","gCmclfAHAt1tEcFDc24eD","TNhxyx7GEdGDM0PBI08b1","guyW7WWQNDGDALFV7tO57","YeEWZtb7FWvYTyJwF7zhR","DUrXQvolf76ILMKJm4Zt6","Jo4jAQcwgxsdxkcxUceR4","X6yPFUKIjs6tENQ3uNzE2","aRSv8qoJLyeE6xDAAUYpU","jwb0toyj23byc7krttp0l8k","ztqrUgUYssC0FAWDGZxWF","d7evrjgli013nul3mosquea","mvBLIZW424WZ5mCmjKQaB","YoV6c5CmpHYNEuYU4PsgH","JQzF2iPfQ2897j6HFCoY9","TicwTJD2oaTpncpPy93s2","KiGGs6PmvIlIt50r2tF2O","4TiqSFRd4hD0e5tyHbf4d","8F9H6GIButHtrFKXHzZFu","t5CaAEDQFRutGrV0ru97d","het26IMKUnKB7npru8tG4","GgRKYXklrXEAs9u15sOM9","PPvKHQNulUEvXEitqAZxM","SMGOfSTElTkJBezhNvkZ6","358nLIVsR9zmItfuBCWq2","xewZxeuhzI7qMvoYdcnLM","FAAtgk8cbuownxuv0Vlou","64N1mdh3JWL1WOv1dilYD","aCd3q2zSzgQnHKi1vOJFj","kh7Y1bQw7Om31yurE4CrW","5162x506d5mgwkn07plcuo3","LGnyEtwA1LlztJJwEpg6l","zoJRWH59vBCpqnm8fOpis","xlg9pngfxviby5z2qfcfpcv","G6zDrHf3Ua8R7vllalBc5","NrjfBxxDU92ByYSIJjgDM","zNcMG5nj1t69zkAFnvn5S","JIHQPGBUDqAEPzbhfFxlc","MmjHaByLtYx5sv2HzXnWd"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nWelcome to my Second Brain!
