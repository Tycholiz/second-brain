<p>Losses evoke stronger negative feelings than costs</p>
<ul>
<li>Ex. Buying a lottery ticket for $5 with 95% chance to lose is more attractive than a bet where there is a 95% chance to lose $5</li>
</ul>
<p>Be wary when making assumptions based on 2+ facts placed side by side. This is a logical fallacy because it demonstrates a cause and effect that may only exist for those with access to those 2+ facts side by side</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. 
<ol>
<li>I worked 7 days/week for several months </li>
<li>I take a weekday off and don't get paid for it. </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If looking at these statements together, there is a sense of injustice delivered by the hands of the person who refused to pay. However, it may not be the case, since this person may not have these 2 facts readily available to them</li>
</ul>
<p>Reacting to someone else's frame is the very thing that causes you to give up frame control.</p>
<p>Laughter in response to something you did is a telltale sign that someone has had their frame shifted</p>
<p>If someone is resisting, don't push. Instead get them to change their frame (if they are upset, use humour)</p>
<p>Whoever controls the options has the power. Creating choices for yourself gives you power.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. Game of thrones. Tyrion didn't like two options of execution or exile, so created a third option: trial by combat, thus retaining power over the situation</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to thinking about benefits, people like certainty (200 people saved > 33% chance to save all 600 people)
When it comes to losses, people become more risk seeking (400 people die &#x3C; 66% everyone dies)</p>
<p>When you describe something, you are implicity creating a context, since words will be influenced by the ones that came before it</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. pay attention to feelings of the person's character arises as each word is read
<ul>
<li>Alan -> intelligent, industrious, impulsive, critical, stubborn, envious</li>
<li>Ben -> stubborn, critical, impulsive, industrious, intelligent</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to the word <em>bank</em> (where it can mean something you sit on, or a place you deposit money, depending on the context), <em>stubborn</em> is ambiguous, since </p>
<ul>
<li>This can be thought of as <em>suppressed ambiguity</em>
<ul>
<li>ex. Halo effect is an example of this </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="decision-making-frames">Decision Making Frames<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#decision-making-frames"></a></h3>
<p>Once you take a particular viewpoint on something, it is difficult to produce reasons for the other side, even if you do not necessarily agree with that viewpoint</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. One group was asked to list various reasons why buying a VCR is a good idea. Then, they were asked to list reasons why it is a bad idea. This second list turned out to be very difficult to product. The next group was asked to do the opposite, and for this group, it was difficult to come up with benefits of a VCR.</li>
<li>This shows that once we take a particular viewpoint, it is difficult to </li>
</ul>
<p>Positive frames tend to elicit positive feelings, and result in proactive and risk-seeking behaviors.</p></div></div><div style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px" class="ant-col ant-col-xs-0 ant-col-md-6"><div><div class=""><div class="ant-anchor-wrapper dendron-toc" style="max-height:calc(100vh - 64px);z-index:1"><div class="ant-anchor"><div class="ant-anchor-ink"><span class="ant-anchor-ink-ball"></span></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#decision-making-frames" title="Decision Making Frames">Decision Making Frames</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ant-divider ant-divider-horizontal" role="separator"></div><footer class="ant-layout-footer" style="padding:0 24px 24px"></footer></main></section></section></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"note":{"id":"4OOQ6LeqSqosTgsU7EmWu","title":"Framing","desc":"","updated":1671753072412,"created":1616900816447,"custom":{},"fname":"psychology.framing","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"../main/thoughts-on","name":"thoughts-on"},"contentHash":"dcedc34fc00b4e44df974df7d48ba48d","links":[],"anchors":{"decision-making-frames":{"type":"header","text":"Decision Making Frames","value":"decision-making-frames","line":38,"column":0,"depth":3}},"children":[],"parent":"4TiqSFRd4hD0e5tyHbf4d","data":{}},"body":"\u003ch1 id=\"framing\"\u003eFraming\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#framing\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLosses evoke stronger negative feelings than costs\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEx.
