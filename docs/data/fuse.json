Thus there is no single “test” for it, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a coherent ideology.\n\nReferring to the third party unknown in male third person (he/him) is not an indication that person thinks literally of them as a male, just like the French speaker doesn’t think of a table as a male object\n- “I may refer to the reader as he, but I no more think of my readers are specifically male than a French speaker thinks of a table as female” -Richard Dawkins\n","n":0.07}}},{"i":3,"$":{"0":{"v":"Willpower","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Will, won't, want \n- 3 things driving our self controlled behavior (i.e. willpower) \n    - Ex. I will work out daily. I won't eat cake after dinner. I want to be strong and have lots of energy\n\n- Prefrontal cortex is where will, won't and want operate. When at full capacity they do a good job. But it is vulnerable to distraction, fatigue, desire, being drunk etc.  Ex. Phineas Gage \n\n- To maximize willpower, try to be fully in the moment Expl. Being distracted depletes in the moment willpower\n\n- People are more likely to be influenced by empty persuasive messages, such as commercials, when they are tired and depleted.\n\n- The ultimate destination should not be “losing 10 pounds,” it should be something intrinsically motivating, such as “Fitting into my sexy black pants\n\n- If you can link something hard to a choice you care about, it makes the task easier\n    - ex. Getting the motivation to go workout every day is difficult, but creating a mental link between being able to work harder and smarter with more energy is something I care about, so it makes the task of working out easier\n\n- The self-control of morning people is impaired at night; the reverse is true of night people.\n\n- The list of situations and tasks that are now known to deplete self-control is long and varied. All involve conflict and the need to suppress a natural tendency.  \n\n- Fight or flight causes your body to suppress impulse control, as all physical and mental energy is directed towards survival\n\n- Anything causing stress on mind or body will reduce reserve of willpower\n\n- Stress encourages focus into the short term goals and outcomes, while self control requires you to keep the big picture in mind\n\n- Slow down breathing to 4-6 breaths per minute. This shifts the body from stress to self control mode\n\n- Fatigue takes place in the mind, not the body. It is a signal from our brain telling us to stop exerting physical effort, like anxiety tells us to be careful and disgust tells us not to eat that thing.\n    - The implication is that feeling fatigue isn't a sign that you will just keel over imminently.\n\n- Tip: imagine how easy it will be to resist that chocolate bar 1 year from now with one years worth of practice\n\n- If your desire for having more willpower (not yell during fights) isn't working, try rethinking what your desire should be. Maybe your desire should be \"be happier in the relationship\"\n\n- Most of the things that make us feel bad about doing something inspire some sort of *ick* feeling inside, such as \"is it morally wrong for 2 consenting siblings to have birth controlled sex?\". The immediate response is yes, but we struggle to come up with a reason. When we are trying to do better on a particular virtue, we feel proud, and award ourselves indulgence credits that we can use.\n    - normally a chocolate cake would cause us to *ick* inside if we are on a virtuous path of healthiness, but if we had previously worked out, then this feeling of *ick* goes away, since we've earned those credits\n\n- Goals should be personal. A bad goal is to \"save money because it is the right thing to do\". \"right thing\" is defined by society, and we don't feel a connection to it. A better goal is \"save money because I want to take next year off and travel the world\n\nTip: page 96\n\n### Halo effect and willpower Labels like *fat free*, *organic*, *free trade*,\n*money saved* allow us to overlook potential attributes that are actually\ndetrimental to our goals. \n\nWhen this happens, focus on the most consistent measure (ex.

With them we may judge whether a set of data has a strong central tendency based on the level of variance that it has.\n- ex. *mean*, *standard deviation*\n- spec: description statistics are backward looking, inductive statistics are forward looking\n- descriptive statistics does not rest on the assumption that the data came from a larger population\n\n### Inferential (Inductive) Statistics \n- aim is to learn about the population that the sample represents\n\t- Therefore, it is developed on the basis of probability theory and by definition, cannot be parametric\n- Statistical inference is the process of analyzing data to make inferences on an underlying\n- Descriptive stats do add valuable context when trying to analyze data inductively. \n\t- ex. in papers reporting on human subjects, typically a table is included giving the overall sample size, sample sizes in important subgroups, as well as demographic info like age, sex, ethnicity\n- The conclusion of a statistical inference is called a `statistical proposition`\n\n## Probability Distribution\n- def - the mathematical function that tells us the probability that each possible outcome occurs. \n- It is a mathematical representation of a random phenomenon\n- It is a function which takes the `sample space` (ie. all possible outcomes) as an input, and returns us the probability of their occurrence.\n\t- ex. of a coin flip, `sample space = {HEADS, TAILS}`\n\t- In other words, we give the function a single possible outcome, and the graph gives us the probability of that outcome occurring (the outcome of an event occurring is a subset of the sample space.\n- the probability distribution and the random variables which they describe underlies the mathematical discipline of probability theory\n- Probability distributions are more preferable than simple numbers for describing a quantity because:\n\t1. There is spread or variability in almost any value that can be measured in a population\n\t2. almost all measurements are made with some intrinsic error\n\t\t- ex. in physics many processes are described probabilistically\n- [Common probability distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_probability_distributions):\n\t- normal distribution, which is related to linear growth\n\t- pareto distribution (pareto principle), which is related to exponential growth\n\n### Discrete Probability Distribution\n- All binomial distributions are discrete\n\t- in other words, they are composed of discrete random variables\n\t\t- variable here, refers to the potential outcomes (observations) that can occur\n- The set of possible outcomes is discrete and predictable\n\t- ex. coin toss, dice roll\n\n### Continuous Probability Distribution\n- All normal distribtions are continuous\n- The set of possible outcomes can take place on a continuous range\n\t- ex. temperatures\n- These probabilities are described by a `probability density function` (PDF)\n\t- This function takes in a single sample from the `sample space` and returns us \"the probability that the input variable would equal that sample in real life\"\n\t- ex. what is the probability that the temperature at 7:00PM, as measured in reality, is equal to the sample recorded in this sample?\n- the absolute likelihood for a continuous random variable to take on any particular value is 0\n\t- This is because there are an infinite set of possible values (ie. infinite sample space)\n\n### Univariate/Multivariate Distribution\n- Univariate - The probability distribution of only 1 random variable\n- Multivariate - The probability distribution of multiple random variables (a vector)\n\t- regression towards the mean can be defined for any bivariate distribution with identical [marginal distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_distribution)\n\n### Kurtosis\n- a staple of probability theory\n- It is a measure of dispersion (along with `variance`, `skewness` and `min/max values`)\n- Kurtosis is a measure of the \"tailedness\" of a distribution\n\t- In other words, the sharpness of the peak of the bell curve\n![](/assets/images/2021-03-27-20-48-10.png)\n\n* * *\n\nThe first step when analyzing any statistical analysis is what ways are they measuring the parameters. For instance if we are measuring popularity of websites have a certain date range, then we would have to know are you calculating that by how many visits the sites gets or are you talking about how much time is spent on each site, and so on by asking questions like this we understand better the true intentions of the author of the analysis\n \nThe way the overall proportion of coin flips settles down to 50% isn’t that fate favors tails to compensate for the heads that have already landed; it’s that those first ten flips become less and less important the more flips we make.\n\nThe null hypothesis, in executive bullet-point form:\n1. Run an experiment.\n2. Suppose the null hypothesis is true, and let `p` be the probability (under that hypothesis) of getting results as extreme as those observed.\n3. The number `p` is called the *p-value*.\n4. If it is very small, rejoice; you get to say your results are statistically significant.\n5. If it is large, concede that the null hypothesis has not been ruled out.\n\n“Statistically noticeable” or “statistically detectable” would be a better term than “statistically significant”\n- That would be truer to the meaning of the method, which merely counsels us about the existence of an effect but is silent about its size or importance.\n\nThe purpose of statistics isn’t to tell us what to believe, but to tell us what to do.\nStatistics is about making decisions, not answering questions.\n\nPie charts should not have more than 3 variables included\n- reasoning: when there are more than 3, our eyes start playing tricks and we are no longer able to draw conclusions from the visualization\n    - verify this claim (originally from Layton) \n\nFaking randomness\n- When people try to purposely make something look random, it ends up being evidence that it wasn't a random process at all. Chunks occur naturally in a randomized process. When we try to fake it, we naturally avoid chunking. This is a clue that it was a faked process.\n- ex. 7738499 is more likely to be a random number than 3950681. the second example has no chunked numbers, and no repeated numbers. This looks deliberately crafted to seem random.\n\n# Population vs Sample\n- population denotes all members of a group. \n\t- spec: Depending on what we are looking at, and what we are interested in, within the stock market, a populate could be every single stock in existence, or it could be every stock in the S&P500. \n\t- populations are difficult to observe in real life\n\t\t- ex. how could we realistically obtain the data with every single student at a university included?\n- sample denotes that we are taking some subset of this population for analysis purposes\n- The goal of statistics is to gather and analyze data from a sample, that also serves as a good representation of the entire population \n- a good sample: each unit in the sample should have had equal % opportunity to enter the sample (from the population).\n\t- ex. if we wanted to get a sample of all students, and went and chose 50 people in the Gym, we are getting a bad sample, because the likelihood of any one person in the gym getting selected for the sample is higher than the likelihood of any one person in the library getting selected for the sample. We are not getting a good representation of the population\n- Samples should be both 100% (ideally) random and representative of the population\n- Statistics are derived from samples, while Parameters are derived from populations\n\t- At a particular time, there may exist a Parameter for the percentage of all voters in USA who prefer Donald Trump, but we obviously can't ask everyone, so we need to take a sample. \n\t- Parameters are therefore more of an ephemeral value that can't actually be obtained in the current moment. We use samples to try and get as close to that parameter as we can. \n\n# Variance, Standard Deviation, Coefficient of Variation\n### Variance \n- measures how far a set of numbers are spread out from their average value\n\t- a measure of dispersion of a datapoint around its mean\n- each data point will be a certain distance away from the **mean line**. This is the variance of a given period\n- variance = sum of squared differences between observed values (the points on a plot) and the population mean (the straight line), divided by total # of observations \n\t- in other words, variance is a function of how far those observed values are from the **mean line**\n- Mathematically, the `variance of the sample = variance of the population / sample size`\n\t- This is because as the sample size increases, sample means cluster more closely around the population mean.\n\n\t\n### Standard Deviation (σ)\n- equal to square root of `Variance`\n- SD is more useful than variance, and variance's biggest value is in letting us easily calculate SD\n- SD is closer to the reality of what it is we are sampling.\n\t- ex. we have a sample of 10 stock prices and have calculated the `SD=3`. Since the units we used for the calculation was `$1`, the SD is also in terms of `$1` (ie. SD is $3) \n- unable to compare different datasets with SD alone (need CV)\n\n### Covariance (cov)\n- the relationship between two variables\n\t- ex. stock price\n- covariance is not the same thing as correlation, but covariance is used in the formula to determine correlation\n- a higher covariance means the stocks tend to move together. Negative covariance means they have little correlation.\n\t- verify this. I suspect that negative value means \"negative correlation\", not \"no correlation\". This would make 0 \"not correlated at all\"\n- like variance, covariance is not a standardized value\n\t- To get a more comparable value, we will need to convert to `correlation`\n- Modern Portfolio Theorists believe that the key is to build a portfolio composed of stocks that have low covariance. \n\t- It is a way to remove non-systemic risk\n\n#### Standard error (SE)\n- def - the SD between samples of a single population\n\t- spec: Therefore, we are getting an idea of how well we sampled the data. The more random and representative a piece of data is, the better sample it is. Therefore, if we got another sample from the same population and there was no variance, we would know we did a perfect job of getting a sample.\n- usually \"Standard Error\" refers to \"Standard Error of the Mean\" (ie. we are measuring the \"mean\" statistic)\n- standard deviation is commonly used to measure confidence in statistical conclusions\n\t- ex. margin of error determined by calculating the expected standard deviation\n\n##### Use\n- With a statistical observation (plotted on a graph), we would have applied formulas to make observations. When we know the SE, we are able to recalculate those formulas with the added benefit of having the SE. This effectively allows us to incorporate the effect of the SE into the function that we have used to generate (secondary) data.\n\n#### Coefficient of Variation (CV)\n- equal to `SD / mean`\n- It simply exists to standardize the variation of a distribution.\n- With this number, we can compare the SD of different datasets\n\t- ex. we are looking at a restaurant menu with prices in both USD and CAD. Ultimately, The SD of each dataset will be different, but the CV will be identical between the datasets\n- tells us the SD relative to the mean\n- [pitfalls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_variation#Examples_of_misuse)\n\n# Distributions\n## Normal Distribution\nA normal distribution of data is like rolling a pair of dice. We know that over many rolls, the most common result from the dice will be seven, and the least common results will be two and twelve.\n- It is a characteristic of normal distributions that 1SD from the mean will cover 68% of cases, 2SD will cover 96% of cases, and 3SD will cover 99.9% of cases.\n\n### Central Limit Theorem\n- as the sample size gets larger, the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution\n- theorem holds especially true for samples sizes over 30\n- ex. if we take 2 die and roll them 1000 times, we will find that the each observed sum will form in the shape of a bell curve, with 7 being in the center and 14 and 2 being in the tails. \n\n## Fat Tail Curves\nif we take A bell curve, we know that the extremes are predictable. we have a tough percentage probabilities that an event in the tail will come to pass. however, with fat tail, we have a situation where there are many unlikely extreme events. each event is still equally as unlikely, but there are a lot more of them, making an extreme outcome more likely than with a bell curve\n- the more extreme events that are possible, the higher the probability that one of them will occur\n- explanation: think of a the heights of a population (normal distribution). there are outliers, but there is a cap on how extreme they will be. we will not see a man 10x the height of the average. but with a curve with fat tails, like wealth, we regularly meet people who are 1000s of times wealithier than the average\n- its a logical fallacy to compare statistics of normal distributions and fat tails \n- ex. there are twice as many deaths from slipping and falling on your head than there are from terrorist attacks. therefore we shouldn't be concerned. the problem with this statement is that slipping and falling is normal distribution, while terrorist attacks are fat tail. put another way, deaths from falling down stairs is pretty bounded. there wont be a 10x increase all of a sudden. the same cant be guaranteed for terrorist attacks\n- Fat tail is just a technical term for Black Swan Events\n\n## Marginal Distribution\n- def - the probability distribution of the variables contained in a subset of data\n\t- ex. given a sample of 100 students and their relation between the amount of time they study and their resulting grades, we can plot what these numbers look like. This is the marginal distribution\n![](/assets/images/2021-03-27-20-48-46.png)\n\t- by adding up the values in the top row (8/200 + 2/100), we can easily determine that 5% of students get a grade of <= 20%\n- Once we have this, we can use **conditional distribution** to answer questions like: \"what is the probability a student studied for 10 hours and received a grade of 20% or less?\"\n- ex. Imagine we are trying to determine the odds of getting hit by a car while crossing the street with a traffic light (at various colors). We will define 2 discrete random variables:\n\t1. H={hit,not hit}\n\t2. L={red,yellow,green}\n\t- H depends on L. In other words, your likelihood of getting hit are increased if L=green.\n\t- This means that for any given pair of H and L, we must consider the bivariate (joint) probability distribution of H and L. We need to determine the probability of that particular pair of events occurring if the pedestrian ignores the state of the light.\n\t- In trying to figure out the marginal probability of being hit `P(H=hit)`, what we are interested in is the probability that the pedestrian is hit, where the color of the light is unknown, and the pedestrian ignores the color of the light \n\t- In this example, we need to know the duration of time each light is on (ie. the probability of any one light being on), and we need to know the probability of getting hit by a car, given the color of the light\n\n### Why we square the differences\n- This serves 2 main purposes\n\t1. Gives us a positive number\n\t\t- We square in situations where we are looking for *magnitude*, and don't care about the direction of that magnitude (ex. variance)\n\t\t- Also if we just add up the first numbers without squaring, we will net out at zero \n\t2. Amplifies the effect of large differences\n![](/assets/images/2021-03-27-20-49-07.png)\n\n### Law of large numbers\nAs individuals, people are completely unpredictable. Okay?

On the other hand, classifying the image as \"not a dog\", when it in fact is, would be an *error of omission*.\n\n* * *\n\n### Confidence Interval\nif a confidence level is 90%, that means that in 90% of the samples taken (from a larger population), the interval estimate will contain the population parameter\nconfidence levels are determined before any analysis (so we don't make the analysis fit the data).\n95% confidence level is most common\n- Factors affecting the width of the confidence interval include the size of the sample, the confidence level, and the variability in the sample\ninterpreting\n- \"Were this procedure to be repeated on numerous samples, the fraction of calculated confidence intervals (which would differ for each sample) that encompass the true population parameter would tend toward 90%.\"\n- The confidence interval can be expressed in terms of a single sample: \"There is a 90% probability that the calculated confidence interval from some future experiment encompasses the true value of the population parameter.\"\n- The explanation of a confidence interval can amount to something like: \"The confidence interval represents values for the population parameter for which the difference between the parameter and the observed estimate is not statistically significant at the 10% level\"\nwhat it is *not*\n- A 95% confidence level does not mean that for a given realized interval there is a 95% probability that the population parameter lies within the interval (i.e., a 95% probability that the interval covers the population parameter). once an interval is calculated, this interval either covers the parameter value or it does not; it is no longer a matter of probability. The 95% probability relates to the reliability of the estimation procedure, not to a specific calculated interval\n\n### Correlation\nrelationships bind facts together, satisfying our human desire to have a narrative explain events (rather than acknowledge that randomness occurs)\n\n### Univariate analysis\nunivariate analysis is oversimplistic and fails to uncover the underlying reasons of why some phenomenon occurs\nex. take the gender pay gap. It's indisputable that in the aggregate, men get paid 9% more than women. However, this oversimplification ignores important factors in pay. For instance, individuals with the personality trait known as Agreeableness tend to get paid less. Women on average tend to be more agreeable than men. Not all women are more agreeable than men, and those women on average get paid more. What if it were the case that a woman and a man have exactly the same personality, and they got paid the same? would that dispel the idea that there is a legitimate gap, or would it just further underline the individual reasons that result in that gender pay gap?\n- This underpins the issue with univariate analysis: you look at a single variable and attempt to understand the picture and all the reasons why that outcome has occurred. What you have failed to realize is that there may be 20 main factors that determine pay inequality, and gender and agreeableness might only constitute 2 of them.\n- Other underlying differences between women and men that may help explain the perceived pay gap: Women tend to be less inclined to take risks, armoire influenced by the chance of loss, or less competitive, and less status conscious.\n","n":0.017}}},{"i":13,"$":{"0":{"v":"Sampling","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Running a sample\n1. start with a focused problem definition.

Whenever you want to understand which variables drive which other variables, and in which direction, it’s the first thing you reach for. And it works on any data set at all.\n- But, like a table saw, if you use it without paying careful attention to what you’re doing, the results can be gruesome.\n\nRegression analysis is good if you want to visualize the relationship between a dependent variable and 1+ independent variables\n\nY hat (written `y`̂ ) is the predicted value of y (the dependent variable) in a regression equation. \n- It can also be considered to be the average value of the response variable.\n\n### Example: Stock price with S&P500 and Unemployment rate\nWe could use Regression analysis to anaylze the price of a stock (*DV*), and put it in the context of the S&P500 AND the unemployment rate (*IV*)\n- we can use these 3 sets of numbers as inputs into a regression function. The return value of that function is a formula that describes the relationship between that DV and IVs that you entered into the function\n\n- The formula is the equation for the Line of Best Fit\n\t- `y = c + b1(x1) + b2(x2)`\n\t\t- `y` = DV\n\t\t- `c` = constant\n\t\t- `x` = IV\n\t\t- `b` = regression coefficient\n\t\t\t- The coefficient represents the degree of change in `y` for each additional unit in that independent variable (`x`).\n\t\t\t\t- if S&P500 `coefficient = 1`, then $1 rise in S&P500 price can explain $1 rise in the stock.\n\n- Drawing from the above example, the stock price would be `y`, S&P500 and UE rate would each be an `x`\n\n### Errors and Residuals\n- *Error* - error is the difference between an observation and the population mean (ie. how it actually is in real life)\n\t- since actually measuring population is very difficult, this number is more theoretical (ie. it is unobservable)\n- *Residual* - residual is the difference between an observation and the sample mean\n\t- making this number something we can actually figure out easily\n\t- therefore the residual is an observed estimate of the error\n- One can standardize statistical errors (especially of a normal distribution) in a z-score (or \"standard score\"), and standardize residuals in a t-statistic, \n- each point on the graph has a value that equals the distance between it and the line. \n- The line may be derived differently, and it really depends on what we are interesting in observing\n\t- ex. we plotted it based on mean\n- Error/Residual: the amount by which a single observation differs from its expected value (the LoBF)\n- If we are using a population mean (ex. all stocks in stock market), then this distance is called the `Error`\n\t- statistical errors are independent, and their sum within the random sample are never zero\n- If we are using a sample mean (ex. all S&P500 stocks), then this distance is called the `Residual`\n\t- the sum of the residuals within a random sample is necessarily zero\n\t\t- Therefore, the residuals are not independent.\n![](/assets/images/2021-03-27-20-51-54.png)\n\n### Line of best fit (LoBF)\n- def - refers to an imaginary line that we draw through the points of data on a scatter plot. \n\t- The closer the points on a scatter plot are to the LoBF, the more reliable the LoBF is for analysis\n\n#### Least Squares Method\n- used to determine the LoBF\n- the method aims to create a straight line that minimizes the sum of the squares of the errors\n\n### Regression to the Mean (RttM)\n- The phenomenon arising when an extreme sample has been drawn. When this occurs, future samples will be closer to the mean on further measurements\n- ex. A QB throws 400 yards in one game. There is high statistical pressure on the QB to perform closer to the mean in his following game due to RttM \n\t- This is because his breakout game was based upon probability, and since likelihood is more based around an average, odds are that the next game will be relatively toned down.\n\n### R-Squared\n- purpose is to tell us how much of the variance of the dependent variable can be explained by the variance of the independent variable \n- \"out of the whole variance of a dependent variable, what portion is able to be explained by the independent variable?\" \n\t- therefore, if R-Squared = 0.5, this means that the model's inputs can explain about 50% of the variation\n- In investing, R-Squared can tell us what percentage of a security's movements can be explained by movements in the whole market\n- ex. We perform a regression analysis, setting our independent variable as GDP and dependent variable as our company's revenue. We find that R-Squared = 0.1, meaning that 10% of our revenue can be explained by movements in the GDP \n- R-Squared only works as intended in a simple linear regression model with one explanatory variable. If we want to include multiple dependent variables, we must use adjusted R-squared.\n- R-Squared is used closely with Beta. While R-Squared measures how closely a dependent variable is correlated to an independent variable, Beta measures how large those variations are \n- According to Nassim Nicholas Taleb, R-Squared only exists in theoretical models, since it doesn't take into account unpredictable events\n\n### Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)\n- def - a tool to estimate unknown parameters in a linear regression model\n\n# Linear Regression\nThink of it like this. On a scatter plot, imagine all possible straight lines. For each line, calculate how closely it fits the dots, by measuring the distance of each dot from the line, and adding up all the distances after having squared them. Of all possible straight lines, the one that minimizes the sum of the squared dot-to-line distances, summed over all the dots, is the fitted regression line. It shows us the trend, without our eyes being distracted by all the mess of the individual points.","n":0.032}}},{"i":15,"$":{"0":{"v":"Probability","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nProbability and relative frequency are two sides of the same coin.\n\n### Denominator neglect\nLow probability events are taken more seriously (ie. Given more weight) when described in terms of relative frequency (e.g. How many times out of 100 it will occur), than when described in abstract terms of probability\n- ex. \"There is a .001% chance you child will get cancer and die\" vs. \"1 / 100,000 children will get cancer and die\".\n\t- The second example is more vivid, leading us to imagine it, and produce cognitive ease. This makes a better story, and makes its likelihood seem higher\n\n### How to determine probability\nfirst access with a base rate is if I am asking what are the odds that Jim is a teacher that I have to find out how many teachers in the population are. For instance if .1% of the population are teachers, with such limited information I must conclude that there is a .1% chance that Jim is a teacher. this is the base rate probability and we should always start here first. from there we can adjust the probability up or down depending on what extra information we have.\n\n### Bayes' Theorem\nBayes’ theorem is a probabilistic approach towards incorporating new information into the model as it becomes available, and updating the probability as a result.\n- The act of adjusting our assessment of the probability is called `Bayesian inference`\n\nDescribe the probability of an event occurring based on prior knowledge that may relate to the event.\n- ex. if the risk of developing health problems is known to increase with age, Bayes’s theorem allows us to assess the risk more accurately, by including the age in the model. Otherwise, we are just assuming that the individual is typical of the population as a whole.\n\n### Zipf's law\nZipf's law states: \"given a large sample of words used, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table.\" \n- So *n*th word has a frequency proportional to 1/n.\n- this means that the second most common word (*of*) will appear 1/2 as often as the most common (*the*), and the third most common (*and*) word will appear 1/3 as often as the most common (*the*)\n- this also means that only about 135 words are needed to account for half the sample of words in a large sample. This holds true for most languages, though the reason is not well understood.\n\nZipf's law applies to:\n- the population ranks of cities in various countries, \n- corporation sizes, \n- income rankings, \n- etc. \n\n# Echo Chamber Danger\n- If all people in one group are coming to similar conclusions, it could be a sign of an echo chamber. Conversely if very different people are saying the same thing, they're probably right.\n    - The likelihood of people using different data (ie. a different source of information) and different perspectives and still arriving at the same conclusion is low.\n\nimprobable things happen all the time because \"improbability\" is an illusion based on our preconceptions. Often it has nothing to do with statistical truth. The trouble is that we can't grasp the difference between (a) \"This particular improbable pattern of lottery numbers came up on this particular day in this particular lottery\" and (b) \"Some improbable pattern of lottery numbers came up sometime in the last five years somewhere in the world.\" In short: \"improbability\" does not imply \"impossibility\".\n\n### The Same Birthday\nConsider a party attended by thirty people: what are the chances that two of them have the same birthday? One in twelve, or, roughly 8% (30/365)? After all, it's a 1 in 365 chance someone will share your birthday, and by the lottery analogy above, there's 30 shots at winning.\n\nNo, the odds are significantly better than that. In fact, there is a 70% probability.\n\nThis is known as the \"birthday problem\". The apparently miraculous breaking of odds is attributed to the fact that the question is \"what is the chance that any two people have the same birthday?\", whereas most people following common sense tend to translate the question as \"what is the chance that someone has the same birthday as mine?\". So while you get 30 shots at this 1 in 365 lottery, so does everyone else. More specifically, every possible pairings of two individuals in the group of 30 has a shot at this 1 in 365 chance. Regardless, the answer is very non-intuitive and is a good display of how people don't do well at guessing probabilities. Once the problem is known, however, calculating the real odds is just a simple case of exploiting the correct mathematics.\n\n# Probability of at least one being selected\nSay we have 6 face-down cards, and 2 are known to be aces. What many people will assume from intuition is the chance of choosing at least one ace when flipping two cards over is 2 in 6 (~33%). This is only true of drawing an ace on the first attempt, however. The actual chance of picking up at least one ace is much better than that.\n\n* * *\n\n### Range of probabilities\nConsider all possible parallel paths of outside effects : janitor who won the lottery would have had 999,999 lives with unsuccessful lottery tickets, and one possible life winning.

Also, 9.6% of women without breast cancer tested positive. What is the probability that any random person that tests positive will actually have breast cancer?\n- most doctors when asked this question will vastly overestimate the probability, placing it at ~80%.\n\t- The most common mistake is to ignore the original fraction of women with breast cancer (only 1%), and the fraction of women without breast cancer who receive false positives (9.6%), and focus only on the fraction of women with breast cancer who get positive results (80% of the 1%)\n\t\t- It seems intuitive that if 80% of people with breast cancer tested positive, then the probability of a woman with a positive test actually having breast cancer is 80%.\n- “The probability that a woman with a positive mammogram has breast cancer” is not at all the same thing as “the probability that a woman with breast cancer has a positive mammogram”\n\nThe Priors\n- **Prior probability** - The original proportion of patients with breast cancer (1%)\n- **Conditional probabilities** - probability that a patient with breast cancer gets a positive mammogram (80% of the 1%), and the chance that a patient without breast cancer gets a positive mammogram (9.6%)\n- see **Round-trip Fallacy**\n\n* * *\n\n### Chaotic system\n- Imagine we had a pseudo-random coin flipper that worked by simply reading the digits of pi. If the number was even, then it is tails. If it was odd, then it is heads. To those who don't know how the heads/tails are derived, it seems random. However in reality it is not really random at all. This is the distinction between a random system and a chaotic system.\n\t- the fundamental truth of a chaotic system is that if we know the inputs, we can determine the outputs. Put another way, it is completely deterministic\n\t- ex. physically flipping a coin is not random, but chaotic, because if we knew the initial linear and angular momentum of the coin, and amount of wind resistance, we could predict every time what the result would be.\n- when you get a bunch of chaotic motions all working together, they end up producing a predictable result\n\t- What this implies is that the more chaotic a system is, the more predictable it is.\n\t- ex. consider a distribution curve metal ball tool. When we turn it upside-down and let all the balls drop, it results in an almost perfect distribution curve. The balls do not \"know\" where to go, but they end up that way.\n\n# Quotes\n- \"any event can have an infinite amount of possible causes\" - Pierre Daniel Huet\n\n# Related\n- [[Combinatorics|math.combinatorics]]","n":0.027}}},{"i":16,"$":{"0":{"v":"Union","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n![[math.set-theory.op.union]]\n\n## Probability of Union sets\nThe general probability addition rule for the union of two events states that \n- $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A \\cap B)$, where $A \\cap B$ is the intersection of the two sets.\n\nThe addition rule can be shortened if the sets are disjoint (ie. have no members in common): \n- $P(A \\cup B) = P (A) + P (B)$\n\ncan even be extended to more sets if they are all disjoint: \n- $P( A \\cup B \\cup C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C)$\n","n":0.105}}},{"i":17,"$":{"0":{"v":"Intersection","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n![[math.set-theory.op.intersection]]\n\nWhen events are independent, we can use the multiplication rule for independent events, which states that:\n- $P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\times P(B)$.","n":0.209}}},{"i":18,"$":{"0":{"v":"Black Swan","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\nFailing to recognize the impact of black swans is summed up in the expression: \"Never mistake the absence of evidence for evidence of absence\"\n- ex. think of the turkey who got fed well every day until getting his head chopped off.

If you're reaching for commas to string thoughts together, you probably need to break the sentence down.\n- every word should do something meaningful. A paragraph has a single responsibility, like a module in programming. Its responsibility is carried out by the sentences.\n- sometimes descriptive words serve a purpose. You have to ask yourself if the words are necessary based on the sentences' purpose. Is it just filler (clutter)? Then cut it out\n- never say anything in writing that you wouldn't comfortably say in conversation\n- Change your perspective when you are writing. Write for yourself, and don't give a damn about what other people think. Write as if you are thinking. \n\t- write in the same manner as when you talk to yourself on walks. Think about the purpose of those talks. In essence, it is a dialogue. It is for you. Keep your writing in the same vein.\n- when reading any sentence, consider the sentence that came before it.\n  - ex. \"The tragic hero of the story is Othello. Small and malevolent, Iago feeds his jealous suspicions.\"\n  - there's nothing wrong with the second sentence, but it doesn't follow well from the first.\n- allow the reader to think for themselves. Lead them down a trail, but let them take their own steps. Don't annoy them by over-explaining.\n  - ex. \"The average double play takes 4.3 seconds, so naturally of you see a player getting to first base in under 4.3 seconds, you're interested in them.\"\n    - we don't need to add a sentence explaining how 4.3 seconds is a great time. \n  - avoid words like \"surprisingly, predictably, of course\", which put a value on a fact before a reader even encounters it.\n\n# Structure\n- The philosophy: think in terms of paragraphs, not sentences.\n- The most important sentence in any article is the first one. If it doesn’t induce the reader to proceed to the second sentence, your article is dead. And if the second sentence doesn’t induce him to continue to the third sentence, it’s equally dead.\n- Every paragraph should amplify the one that preceded it.\n\n## Hook\n- Often the hook comes from some odd fact that the author was able to discover, rather than originating from the author's style.\n  - ***ex.*** - \"I spent the afternoon taking notes at the museum, focusing my attention to one piece in particular\". The sentence is structured in such a way that it creates intrigue about what insight the author picked up\"\n\n# Direction\n- Make it clear to the reader what they stand to gain from reading this particular piece. Create intrigue where possible by baiting.\n    - For this reason, \"setting the stage\" is generally a bad idea, as it wastes time.\n- Now, what do your readers want to know next? Ask yourself that question after every sentence.\n- Readers should always feel that you know more about your subject than you’ve put in writing.\n## Surprise <get notes from On Writing Well>\n\n# Grammar\n- Use active verbs to invigorate the sentence.\n  - eg. \"*Launch* a business\", as opposed to \"*Starting* a business\"\n  - tip: avoid verbs that include an appended preposition. \n    - ex. set up, get on\n\n### Dead sentence\n- a sentence where the reader is unable to visualize anybody performing some activity.\n\n# Words not to use\n- quite\n- rather\n\n* * *\n\n### Hedging word - basically any word you use that undermines the desire of the sentence.\n- *ex.* \"and yet, on balance, I think it was a success\"\n\n### Inactive vs active sentences\nThe problem with these sentences is that they have no people in them and they have no working verbs.

We have to allow the student to reach their conclusion on their own.\n- ex. In presenting a statistical experiment (seizure experiment) to students, telling them that only 4 out of 15 people helps the seizure victim does not cause them to remember the idea. Instead if we show them an interview between two people and they both nice, then tell them that these two are among the 11 that didn't help the seizure victim. Then the students inherently understand that just because you're a nice doesn't mean you will help the victim. In the second scenario students remembered and learned the core psychological concept much better\n\n\"Do not train boys to learning by force and harshness, but lead them by what amuses them, so that they may better discover the bent of their minds\" —Plato\n\nSimplify the world you are teaching.\n- ex. in WoW website section where they are introducing game to new players, there is very digestible chunks of information presented. what makes the info so digestible is that it presents  a simplified version of the world. For instance, when they say \"the numbers 1-0 on the keyboard correspond to spells\", they could have gotten more technical, and talked about how all keys on the keyboard are customizable, or that spells can be cast by clicking a button on the mouse. They simplified the world, favoring just presenting enough information to understand the purpose of the keys. \"ok there is an action and reaction type relationship here. multiple spells, multiple keys. got it. At this level of understanding, it's irrelevant that keys are customizable.\nThis is an enlightening lesson for teaching/educating people, because as people who have a good view of the whole picture, it is easy to lose sight that those new to the world do not need to see that picture.too. It is more difficult when you are passionate about that field, because you find all parts of the world fascinating, and are more likely to want to share it, even if it is not the best thing. You get too excited about it and share too much, frustrating the other person, because they cant process all the info you are throwing at them.\nWhen teaching something, consider the \"happy path\" of understanding something\n- ex.  \"chords are 3 or 4 notes played together. Most common 3 note chords are major and minor\"\n    - this simplifies the fact that there are actually possibilities of lots of notes in chords\n\nStudents should be allowed to reach their own conclusions, Pestalozzi preached, by using a series of steps that began with hands-on observations and then proceeded to intuitions, conceptual thinking, and visual imagery.\n\nIf you were to teach how to compute the average, the multiplication, and the division of a number but didn't tell him the method, what they would have to do is figure out how to do the calculation based on their understanding of what multiplication actually is . teaching them this way is what allow for far greater understanding of the underlying concepts than if the student were just given a formula\n- develops higher order thinking skills\n\n# Teaching Children\nIt is very easy for an adult to get a glimpse into a child's brain. Imagine a child who is to learn the names of the days of the week. This child has no scheduled events such us the Sunday mass, or Saturday soccer. For this child, there is less difference between Tuesday and Thursday than there is a difference between Ganymede and Calisto. To learn the names of the days is like attaching labels to vacuum. Entirely futile and asemantic. The adult may reason \"these are vital terms the child will need in her life\".\n\nTo remedy the empathy problem, the adult can imagine the year split into 36 ten-day periods with each period assigned a specific name: Primedec, Secdec, Winterdec, Febdec, etc. How about learning that sequence just for a test? Only 36 names (just to compensate for adult metacognitive superiority). All adults, with no exceptions, rejects such a proposition. This is exactly how a child feels. A bunch of names to learn with no content and no purpose! This is classic asemantic learning.\n\n* * *\n\nwhen showing someone something new (ex. boardgame), show them examples of not just what they can do, but what they can do in combination with other moves. For instance, if showing someone Catan, don't just show them that if they build on a port, then they can trade wheat 2:1. Show them that by building on the port, they can trade wheat 2:1, which when coupled with their other settlements on wheat nodes, will allow them to control the commodity and trade it for any commodity they need, making them less reliant on other players.\n- Presenting it in this way allows the others to visualize how *they* are going to play, allowing this information you just gave a chance to seep in and see if it fits in with their own playstyle.\n\nA good teacher can only teach you the rules, as a good student it's your job to know the exceptions.\n","n":0.034}}},{"i":30,"$":{"0":{"v":"Storytelling","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nCapture attention before telling the story, instead of using the story to grab attention.\n- Important key is to use preamble to capture attention. It is almost like creating anticipation in people's minds. You are \"commanding\" their attention because of the impression you are giving that what you are about to say is intriguing.\n- ex. let me tell you why that was a big deal, Jim (using the name is important, because people's ears perk upon hearing their own name)\n\nWhen recounting a story, don’t tell it from the vantage point of “everything turned out okay.”  Express how it felt in the moment.  Get into the fear, uncertainty, or excitement you felt in real time.  Let the emotions play out in your voice, your body, and your eye contact.\n- If you tell a tense story with a tonality and body language that communicates, “Everything turned out okay,” you’ll lose interest.\n- Let the audience know what you knew at the time. Let them feel what you felt at the time. You yourself must feel what you want your audience to feel, because emotions are contagious.\n\nThe storyteller's primary job is to uncover the emotional journey they want the listener to go on and then do everything in their power to support that journey.\n- You find that journey by asking, “Why am I telling this story?”\n\nRegardless of the size of the group you are talking to, address them as “you.”  Every person is experiencing the story alone (inside their own head). \n\nIt is the consistency of the information that matters for a good story, not its completeness.\n\nwhen you tell a story, you have to tell it from the persetive of yourself as you were at the qoment the story was unfolding.\n\nex. I went into the living room where Eliza and Maggie were sitting on the couch with the tv on. I sat next to Elizabeth and after a while, had it dawn on me that the volumeis off. I look at Maggie and she seems to be watching attentively. Confused, I ask Elizabeth \"why is the volume off?\". She smiles and says \"It's not\". Even more confused, I listen intently again. Not hearing a peep from the tv, I conclude that it is in fact muted. Elizabeth is in disbelief that I cannot hear the tv. I too am in disbelief, so I ask maggie if she can hear. She replies she can, and I realize my hearing sucks.\n\nThis way of telling a story is better, because  subject of my story (ie. me) is not omniscient. There is a limit to what the subject knows. In fact, that limit is identical to what you knew during the actual event. \n\nImagine if we had told the story while giving away the twist, which was that the volume was actually on the whole time? In the story above, I enter the room and assert that the volume is off. It is unexpected to later learn that in fact it was something else entirely. \n\nWith this method, you are taking the listener on a journey with your then-self and all of its awareness and understanding.\n\nTo be good (and convincing) in your storytelling, you need to have the rough high-level narrative mapped out in your head beforehand. You have to know how the story will go and have identified the main elements\n- ex. when telling story about how I bought the wrong type of thermostat, identify:\n\t- the background - bought a new thermostat and tried installing it\n\t- the surprise (or inciting incident) - there are different types of thermostats, and this is the wrong one\n\t- purpose of story - you are willy nilly when buying things on Amazon because you think \"if it doesn't work, I can return it easily\". However, when it comes time to actually have to return an item, we realize how much pain and effort it actually is.\n\na story gives a sequence of events meaning. This is why when people make narratives to explain events, we should be wary. Humans are drawn to meaning, and meaning that is retroactively applied to a sequence of events makes something seem more meaningful than it actually is\n\n### Show, don’t tell\nScott doesn’t tell us “I felt sick.”  He shows us, “I left the camp to go throw up.” \n","n":0.038}}},{"i":31,"$":{"0":{"v":"Speaking","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Verbal fluency\n- Achieved when *cognitive load* is minimized and *working memory* is maximized.\n\n## Decreasing cognitive load\n- eliminate distractions.

Logos - an appeal made from logic standpoint\n2. Pathos - an appeal made from emotional standpoint\n3. Ethos - an appeal made from credibility standpoint (demonstrating EI, fairness, accomplishments)\n\nMajority of people are swayed by methods other than logos\n\nTo counteract an argument made from pathos (emotional argument), you need to also make a pathos argument with the goal to soften their emotions. Then, once emotions have been softened, mix in logical arguments. The goal is to mold facts into rhetoric that can be received emotionally\n\nLook for opportunities to apply positive reinforcement with people who you deal with for example use methods such as praise or profuse gratitude\nEx.

The idea is to introduce what is wrong with your side, which will cause the other side to see you as more honest. As each detriment is revealed, the responder evaluates the negative impact on their own situation. This gives them confidence that the downside of the position have already been revealed, and that if nothing stands out as a serious detriment, then it is a potentially good side to adopt to (ex. make a purchase, adopt a viewpoint)\n\nImplications:\n1. Leading with weakness disarms the audience.\n\n2. Too much optimism seems like salesmanship.\n\n3. Critical comments are perceived as smarter than positive ones.\n\n4. Starting negative boosts trust.\n\n5. Listing negatives makes it harder for listeners to think of their own objections.\n\n* * *\n\nIt’s best to introduce a delay between the presentation of the idea and the evaluation of it, which provides time for it to sink in.\n- ex. If you’re making a suggestion to a boss, you might start with a 30-second elevator pitch during a conversation on Tuesday, revisit it briefly the following Monday, and then ask for feedback at the end of the week.\n\nInstead of assuming that others share our principles, or trying to convince them to adopt ours, sometimes it is better to present our values as a means of pursuing theirs. It’s hard to change other people’s ideals. It’s much easier to link our agendas to familiar values that people already hold. *-Originals*\n\n# Negotiation\nThe single most important skill in negotiation is the ability to put yourself in the other side’s shoes.\n\njust as important as the facts, if not more important, are people’s perceptions of those facts.\n\nthink in advance about what standards you could appeal to in your negotiation. Do your homework on market rates, scientific criteria, costs, technical measures, and precedents. Come armed to persuade.\n\nThink of batna as the floor to a deal. The worst case scenario isnt so bad\n\nNever make an important decision on the spot. Go to the balcony and make it there.\n\nParaphrasing is one of the most useful techniques in a negotiator’s repertoire.\n\nOne of the most powerful and surprising ways to acknowledge the other side’s point is to preempt it. Take the words out of their mouth. Tell them: “If I were in your shoes, this is the way I’d see it.”\n\nDo the opposite of what they taught you in graduate school. There, if someone said something you agreed with ninety-nine percent, you said, ‘I disagree,’ and you focused on the one percent of disagreement. Here, if my constituent says something you disagree with ninety-nine percent, I want you to say, ‘I agree with you’ and focus on the one percent of agreement.”\n\nWhen in a conflict, have people see the situation the way you do, and appeal to an honor and nobility (sense of fairness, sense of what is right) that everybody wants to have.\nEx. If someone wants to back out of their lease, claim that “I don’t think you would do that, because I believe you to be a man of your word. I would wager that you do not want to leave because I believe this to be true. If you still want to leave by the end of the month, I will admit I was wrong and terminate the lease.”\n\nOne of the most familiar tricks of the orator or propagandist is to leave certain things unsaid, things that are highly relevant to the argument, but that might be challenged if they were made explicit.\n\nWhen trying to convince someone of your beliefs about something, sometimes it is more effective to give an example (an instance of your belief system) to demonstrate that belief. Visualization is a better way to convince.\n- I want to get a job at a startup, and want to demonstrate my belief that \"money is the lifeblood of a business, and my desire is to see this business survive, not to just make a quick buck for myself.\"\n    - Instead, say \"if you were to sit there and offer me $80,000/yr, I would decline. I understand that money is the lifeblood of a business, and can't survive without it. If I were to take that money, the company wouldn't survive and we'd have nothing.\"\n- Stating it like this clearly shows the thought process behind what our beliefs are, and allows people to better remember our character, and be convinced of our motivations. This is important because many people are all talk, and sometimes say the things that we genuinely believe. In order to rise above those bullshitters, we need to demonstrate that it is truly the way that we feel.\n\nUsing the phrase \"in that case\" gives you a lot of negotiating power. It's almost as if you have clearly defined the possible paths that lay before us, and are giving the outcomes of what will happen in the event that we go down one particular path. You are not seen as imposing, since they made the choice. You are simply communicating the outcome of that choice.\n\nAsk them, “ What kind of evidence would you need to see the change of position on this?”\n- If the answer to this question is “nothing”, then you’re dealing with theology, not science. At least if the person can give you some kind of study that they would need to see, then we know we are dealing in the realm of science.\n\nWhen influencing someone, you have to always consider the role that the interlocuter's environment will have on them. Even if I make a fantastic argument and I've seemingly made progress, they are going to return to that environment eventually, and along with it, many people who passionately argue the contrary. A better strategy is to try and plant a seed that they will recognize (something that is a part of their environment). Relate this seed back to the point you were trying to make.\n- ex. trying to convince a religious person that Christianity is all about discouraging people from asking questions. That concept is the seed. Give light examples, like \"don't question the pastor\", \"faith is paramount (at expense of reason)\"\n- The best seeds are the ones that are easy to recognize and occur frequently.\n\nThe desired outcome (goal) of a persuasive argument (for those you have a long-term interest in) is to ensure that the other party has correctly understood your position. The logic is important, because we all have logical things that we still disagree with. The fact that it is logical allows the doors to remain open for our thoughts to change, though. No one wants to believe in something that is illogical, so if we take care of that first issue off the bat, we set ourselves up for potential adoption in the future.\n- counterintuitively, our goal shouldn't be in trying to persuade them. Plant the ideas and let them grow. Truth will always prevail in the end.\n\nWhen someone is giving you pushback on adoption of an idea (or sale), probe further to get to the root cause of their concern. Is it possible you can uncover that discomfort and assuage it in some way?\n\n* * *\n- when debating an issue, the specific arguments we make are more effective when we demonstrate that we have considered the second-order effects (ie. the effects of the effects, and so on)\n\n- don't argue— focus on the method of logic being used\n\n- humans will believe anything as long as you allow confidence. it is much easier to exhibit self confidence if you are exceedingly polite and friendly\n\n* * *\n\nby making declarations that the person is likely not to agree with 100%, you put them on the defensive. however, if we are able to put the ball in their court, then we force them to imagine the question, and are more likely to be honest with themselves.\n- there is an incentive for the other party to answer truthfully to this question as well, as if they have not succeeded in what they set out to do, failing for lack of trying is much preferable to failing for lack of competence.\n\nWhat reaches the heart without going through the mind is likely to bounce back and put the mind out of business.\n\nWhenever possible try to keep money out of things. For instance if a customer request an extra feature, say \"Well, we'll do anything for a pizza. This is a lot more personal than saying will do it for $15.\n- *Anything you Want - Derek Sivers*\n\n\"Whenever you see them looking up, back off\"\n- here, looking up is to indicate that something you said made them stop and think about it.

Helping someone out makes you feel overall competent about your abilities, and makes you feel good about having helped someone.\n\ndon't worry so much about how to start off saying what you want to say. Just start speaking, and the confidence that you say things in, the thoughtfulness that you put into it. That is what is going to determine the feel and interpretation of your message.

Just go in and say something and think about it as you're speaking give them your attention and your focus, and the words will just come naturally.\n\nSitting/standing asymmetrically projects a sense of relaxation and confidence\n\nImagine showing somebody David Bowie's Blackstar and asking their opinion. Their response, is that they think this is bad music. In response, you say \"but is it the music that's bad or is it the fact that makes you feel uneasy\".

Often it is a result of your brain's attempt to simplify information processing.\n- *\"A cognitive bias is a systematic error in thinking that occurs when people are processing and interpreting information in the world around them and affects the decisions and judgments that they make.\"*\n\n## Why they happen \n- When you use a formula you don't understand, it is effectively a black box to you. The same thing happens when the brain makes errors in logic. We feel a certain way, for instance, that death rate by hurricane is larger than death rate by heart attack, but we don't know necessarily where this feeling is coming from. We are just told the answer, and our intuition is to trust it.\n- Generally, intuition is a way of saying, \"I sense similarities between this problem and other ones I have worked on. Before I work on this problem, I have some expectation about the answer.\"\n- given that intuition is an evolutionary construct, a rule of thumb is to put more trust into it in natural environments, and less trust in non-natural environments. \n\n* * *\n\nThink of cognitive biases as little army men that work against you. When we make a great decision, it is because there were less army men present. Bad decisions arise because there were many.\n\nWhen the solution to a problem does not seem proportionate to the problem itself, people tend to resort to extremes.\n- ex. When people are told a serious threat like Coronavirus is coming, but that all they need to do is wash their hands, they see the solution as innocuous and a useless measure against something so impactful. The action doesn't seem proportional to the threat, so they act irrationally, buying up toilet paper.\n\n#### Conflicting messages\n- when one authority says there is no problem, and another says there is a problem, it causes people to worry, which begets irrational behavior \n  - ex. During covid-19, WHO said to take extra precaution, while Trump said not to worry about it. Conflicting opinions from authorities causes people to worry \n- when people are stressed, their reason is hampered. They then look at what others are doing (buying toilet paper) and follow suit.\n  - there is a lot of value in \"social\" knowledge. \n\n### Illusory Superiority\nwe judge ourselves by our intentions, and judge others by their actions. in effect we have a lower benchmark for ourselves than we do for others\n\n### Fallacy of conjunction\nwe are heavily influenced by vivid and readily available evidence.\n- the influence is so deep that we are willing to make judgments that violate simple logic\n- ex. Linda is 31 years old single outspoken and very bright. she majored in philosophy. as a student she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in the anti-nuclear demonstrations.\n- question: what is more probable: Linda is a bank teller? or Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement?\n- the law of mathematics guarantee that the first option is more likely, yet the majority of people choose the second\n\n\n### Retrospective Distortion\nthere are millions of factoids that prevail leading up to an event. only a few of those factoids turn out to be relevant to our understanding of what happened. as a result, we will take those few factoids and justify why the event happened, claiming that it was predictable\n\nex. people living through the beginning of WWII didnt have any inkling as to how momentous the event would turn out to be. it is only with the benefit of retrospect that we can see that.\n- bond prices around the start if the war reflect this. bond prices are a good reflection of sentiment around government\n\n### Substitution\n- when posed a difficult question or one that requires some degree of analysis, people will generally substitute the question for one which has a more readily available answer come to mind\n- ex. “The question we face is whether this candidate can succeed. The question we seem to answer is whether she interviews well. Let’s not substitute.”\n- When something becomes hard to think about, people transfer the discomfort of the thought to the object of their thinking.\n- ex. “Happiness these days” is not a natural or an easy assessment. A good answer requires a fair amount of thinking. However, the students who had just been asked about their dating did not need to think hard because they already had in their mind an answer to a related question: how happy they were with their love life. They substituted the question to which they had a readymade answer for the question they were asked.\n\n### Loss Aversion\nLoss aversion is only a factor when the the participants plan to use or \"consume\" that particular item. Ex. Trading $100 for shoes doesn't cause loss aversion because the $100 was seen as an instrument in the person's mind. It was not to be consumed in any other way. Put another way, the purchase was already decided. However, trading 12 vacation days a year for $10000 cash causes loss aversion because those vacation days were to be consumed. Vice versa for this example too\n\n### Mental shotgun \n- it's difficult for people not to naturally think of more than you ask them (eg what do you think of Donald Trump's hair? It's difficult not to consider his competency overall, or effectiveness as a president etc)\n\n### WYSIATI (*What you see is all there is*)\nYou cannot help dealing with the limited information you have as if it were all there is to know. You build the best possible story from the information available to you, and if it is a good story, you believe it.\n\n### Halo Effect (?)\nex. You meet a woman named Joan at a party and find her personable and easy to talk to. Now her name comes up as someone who could be asked to contribute to a charity. What do you know about Joan’s generosity? The correct answer is that you know virtually nothing, because there is little reason to believe that people who are agreeable in social situations are also generous contributors to charities. But you like Joan and you will retrieve the feeling of liking her when you think of her. You also like generosity and generous people. By association, you are now predisposed to believe that Joan is generous. And now that you believe she is generous, you probably like Joan even better than you did earlier, because you have added generosity to her pleasant attributes.\n\n### Zeigarnik effect \n- people remember incomplete/interrupted tasks better than they remember completed ones. In other words, a desire to complete a task can cause a person to remember it until it has been completed, because its full execution leads to forgetting it altogether.\n\n### Fundamental Attribution Error \nAttributing some negative quality to the other party's character, while exhibiting that same behavior, but attributing it to circumstance\nEx. At a buffet, one person says to another, “Let’s stock up before all the hoarders get here,” as if preemptive hoarding is different from hoarding.\nEx. People on the collectivist Left often discount the evils historically associated with socialism, attributing them to totalitarianism or dictatorship, while attributing the evils historically associated with capitalism to its very nature, which they identify as the selfish profit motive. People on the libertarian Right, meanwhile, often dismiss the evils historically associated with capitalism, attributing them to corruption or government interference, while describing the historical evils associated with socialism as the inherent features of an evil ideology that tramples over individual rights.\n\n### Publication Bias\noccurs when there is a disproportionate amount of people who publish sigbificant result studies compared to people who publish null studies. This results in more studies being about significant results and giving a false reality as to how many tests are significant and how many are null\n- people naturally dont want to publish null papers\n\n### Round trip fallacy\n- def - The confusion of absence of evidence that unexpected, high impact events (Black Swans) have occurred, or will occur, with evidence of absence of such events (no possible Black Swans). ... But it would be erroneous to infer that there is evidence of the absence of all such events.\n- ex. almost all muslims are terrorists and almost all terrorists are vastly different. if 99% of terrorists are muslim, this only amounts to 0.001% of all muslims.\n- ex. \"conservatives are generally stupid\" is vastly different from \"stupid people are generally conservative\"\n- ex. \"there is no evidence of cancer\" vs \"there is evidence of no cancer\"\n- ex. in science, \"absense of evidence\" vs \"evidence of absence\" — scientists who thought formula was as good as breastmilk\n\n### Confirmation Bias\nOnce you notice something, confirmation bias causes you to keep noticing it and see a pattern, while ignoring things that don’t fit the narrative.\t\n#### Seeing only events and never the rules\nan experimenter gives a sequence of 3 numbers: 2, 4 ,6 and says that this sequence was derived from a rule. the objective is for the subject to find the rule by presenting his own sequence of numbers (ex. 4, 6, 8). if their sequence follows the rule, the experimenter will confirm the events. once the subject is satisfied they understand the rule, they will make the general statement. for example, many say \"the numbers are always 2 apart.\" however, the true rule was simply \"the numbers are ascending\". \nthis is an interesting experiment, because the subjects had a rule in mind based on the (weakly) established pattern: the numbers rise by 2 each time. their instinct is to confirm this theory they have by asking the experimenter \"is 4,6,8 right? is 10,12,14 right?\". what they never realize is that the rule is much simpler, and the generality they are making is far too general. they are making a general rule based off less information than should be necessary to make that rule in the first place\nthis problem of creating a general rule from a strict set of observations is called naive generalization\n\n#### Combating Confirmation Bias\nYou have to seek out the contrarian opinion to what you want. If you want to buy a new game that looks cool, you naturally *want* to like it. You are going to look for things that confirm your opinion to buy the game. This of course produces the effects of confirmation bias.\n- What you should be doing, rather, is googling for things like \"anno is ____\" to see what comes up. Search \"anno sucks\" and see what comes up. What do the game's detractors say about it? Repetitive? \"Ah, that's not really the game style I enjoy\"\n\n\n### Narrative Fallacy\n- not theorizing takes effort; theorizing is default\n\t- human behaviour is to make sense of raw facts by making narratives. it takes considerable effort to resist making a story while taking in facts\n- ex. consider a \"whodunit\" novel. the author paints the picture in such a way that each character has a plausible chance of being the killer. in fact, if you were to assign a probability to each person, you will find that the sum adds up to well above 100% \n- humans pull memories along causative lines\n\t- ie. memories change over time to fit more comprehensive and cohesive narratives\n- Any time we draw a causative link (ie. saying \"*this* happened **because** *this* happened\"), we have to ask if someone's survival was at stake.\n\t- ex. \"he won lots of money at the casino **because** he is skilled\"\n\t- when survival is involved, the notion of \"because\" is severely weakened. The condition of survival drowns all possible explanations. \n\t\t- in other words, be careful not to look for explanations when survival is a factor. More often than not, is can simply be attributed to luck and randomness. \n\n### Ludic Fallacy\n- def - the tendency to stick too closely to the rules of a game, causing any unexpected occurrences to break the paradigm that you have built, making you unable to respond in an effective way.\n- ex. consider boxers who learn to fight, but only within the confines of the rules laid out by boxing. If boxers were to have a street fight, they would be severely disadvantaged, since the paradigm of fighting they have created is defined by the rules of boxing\n- ex. consider body builders who do all of their training in the confines of a gym. Once they exit the gym, they are disadvantaged in trying to lift anything that does not have the same motion. \n- the ludic fallacy is a major reason why mathematical forecasting models are ineffective. The confines of the model are too narrow (ie. they are based on platonified forms)\n\t- we will never have all the information, and small variations in data may result in massive changes. \n\n\n### Two-Track Analysis (Charlie Munger)\n- When analyzing any situation where decision making by people is involved, consider:\n    - How would they act if they behaved rationally?\n    - How might they succumb to the pull of a number of irrational and psychological biases?\n        - ex. making inferences based on small sample sizes\n        - ex. remain irrationally committed to something we've said in the past\n\n### When too much incremental information can be a bad thing\n- when you get information too rapdily (and with little incremental time between instances of information), you tend to form more hypotheses along the way. This causes you to recognize what is coming far later than someone who is getting information less frequently\n- ex. imagine showing a picture of a blurry fire hyrant to two different groups (blurry enough that you can't recognize what it is). To the first group, you define 10 progressively less blurry versions of the image, and to the second, you define only 5 (in other words, the first group will have a smaller incremental difference between each step). In this example, the 4th step for the first group will be the same as the 2nd step for the second group. As it so happens, the second group will recognize the hydrant quicker than the first group when both are seeing the same image (ie. step 4 and 2, or 6 and 3 etc.). This is because we are forming hypotheses along the way about what it is, and get too narrowly focused on those assumptions, thereby hampering our abilities to work out what we are actually looking at. \n- The problem is that our ideas are sticky, and once we produce a theory, we are unlikely to change it. Therefore, those who delay forming a theory are better off. When you form an opinion on the basis of weak evidence, you have difficulty interpreting subsequent information that contradicts this theory. \n\t- this is due to confirmation bias and belief perserverance (the tendency not to reverse opinions you already have). \n\n### Source of Knowledge\nQuestion where your knowledge came from. If the source is not reputable, there is absolutely no reason you should maintain ANY prior opinions that you had on the subject.\n- ex. When asked about power plants, my first impression is \"they are safe and probably a good thing to have\". However, I don't recall where that sentiment came from. Could it have come from an unbiased individual? Could it have come from someone who was mistaken? Without any of this knowledge, it is really not fair to have any sort of an opinion on nuclear power. As such, I should have a clean slate as if I'd never even heard of it in the first place\n\n# UE Resources\n- [Overcomingbias][https://www.overcomingbias.com/]\n\n# Related\n- [[logic.fallacy]]\n","n":0.02}}},{"i":52,"$":{"0":{"v":"Survivorship Bias","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\na.k.a Silent Evidence\n\ndef - the bias of focusing the attention on the people who were successful in a particular endeavor, rather than focusing on the whole population, which would include a far greater number of those who are unsuccessful.\n- It is a form of seletion bias\n\nEssentially, survivorship bias can exist anywhere that the voices of the survivors are the only ones existing. Those that did not make it past the gate are not able to add their voices to the conversation to add equity to the discussion.\n\nex. When we analyze companies, failed companies are excluded from the analysis, giving an illusion as to why the successful companies succeeded in the first place.\n\nAny business that focuses on giving advice is an inherent victim of survivorship bias, since of course those who failed will never have their voices heard\n\n## Examples\nwhen you go to the hospital you'll see a lot more people will bullet wounds in their legs than people will bullet wounds in their chests. This doesn't mean people don't get shot in the chest; it means that people who get shot in the chest don't recover.\n\n### Abraham Wald's Aircraft Bullet holes\nDuring WWII, there were a number of military planes that survived gunfire and made it back to the military bases for repair. The military's stance was to reinforce the areas that were penetrated most by gunfire. A mathematician named Abraham Wald realized that this was succumbing to survivorship bias, since the planes that did not survive were not there to tell their story. Most likely, those planes did not survive because they were not hit in the same places as the survivors. This meant that the spots that needed reinforcing were the parts of the plane that were not even hit on the survivors. The likely reason why the failed-planes were shot down was because the areas they were hit in were not the same areas that the survivors were hit in, causing them to fall.\n\n\n- ex. during a shipwreck the praying people recount that it was their praying that saved them. however, what we dont see are the stories of those who prayed and also perished\n- silent evidence is what events use to conceal their own randomness (particularly the black swan variety)\n- neglect of silent evidence is endemic when we study comparative talent (particularly in winner-take-all activities)\n- consider 2 professions: writers and doctors. there are far more writers who work at Starbucks than those who make a professional living as a writer. on the other hand, there are hardly any doctors who work at anything other than medicine. therefore we can use the second group as an effective sample of the population, whereas the first would provide a poor sample (since we'd likely be neglecting those writers working at Starbucks) \n- consider professions like doctor to be ones without superstar effects, making their sample more representative\n- this doesnt mean that a person who becomes a superstar isnt skilled, but it does imply that there are many non-survivors who are equally as skilled, but just didnt have the luck that the survivors had. in other words, they arent less skilled, but they are less uniquely skilled\n- ex. a newspaper article says \"russian mafia composed of members hardened by the gulag\". to see why this causative statement is a fallacy, consider a good cross section of the rat population: big, small, fast etc. shine a shot of radiation at all of them, so that the weaker ones die. what you are left with is a subpopulation of stronger rats. if we were to be ignorant of the ratiation that was shot at the rats, we would get a false impression of the average strength of the rat population.\n- survivorship bias hides best when thr impact is largest (ie. the less survivors, the more they will come to \"claim\" to represent the whole group)\n- dont forget that survivorship bias can work in the opposite way too. \n\t- ex. consider that its likely that our perception of a criminal is flawed, since the less intelligent ones are more likely to get caught.\n- consider evolution. perhaps most mutations have a negative consequence. you might be tempted to think that evolution is always improving us, but that's not the case. the negative mutations kill off the species that receive them, putting them in the silent graveyard that no one talks about and considers as part of the grander statistic\n- in order to understand success and what caused it, you must look at the failures and study the traits present in those\n\t- ex. studies of rich and famous people focuses exclusively on them. they take a population of hot shots, those of big titles and big jobs, and study their attributes. they look at what those big guns have in common: courage, risk-taking, optimism etc. it is then inferred that these traits help you become successful. take this scenario and apply it to a gym, or anything where there will be people who invariably drop out along the way. the resulting population skews our perceptions of reality\n\nThe expression “what Does not kill me makes me stronger” might actually mean “what did not kill me did not make me stronger, but spared me because I am stronger than others. It killed others, and as a result of the average population is now stronger, because the weak are gone.”\n- Here we see the transfer of [[antifragility]] from the individual to the system. The system gets stronger at the expense of its weaker components\n\n#### Silent Victims\nconsider when an event like hurricane katrina happens. governmental money gets redirected from places like cancer, where more deaths occur each year as a result.\n- a life saved is a statistic; a person hurt is an anecdote\nconsider when we look at someone having built in job security as a result of union policy. we ascribe this to social benefits, but fail to consider the person who has a tough time finding a job as a result\nconsider 9/11 and the people afterwards who were scared of flying. they instead opted to drive, thereby increasing the amount of deaths (since flying is riskier than driving)\n","n":0.031}}},{"i":53,"$":{"0":{"v":"Stereotyping","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nAny time you are putting a label on someone (ex.

At this point, water turns into a vapor.\n\nBoiling happens when water molecules have enough energy to spread out and form bubbles. These bubbles rise to the surface and release water vapor.\n- When we increase the air pressure around the water, we are putting literally more pressure on these molecules, and it becomes more difficult for them to spread out. Therefore, the threshold of boiling increases.\n- When we decrease the air pressure, it's easier for these molecules to spread out, which is our definition of *Boiling*\n- water only boils at 100 °C at sea level.

When you push water in a syringe, the air bubble will get smaller as we make the chamber smaller. This shows that as pressure increases, water molecules are getting closer together, and the boiling temperature threshold will rise.\n\nPressure makes it difficult for boiling to take place, which is why water boils in a vacuum: It's not that vacuums cause water to boil, it's that less pressure results in easier conditions under which water can boil (ie. lower temperatures)\n- as a result, water boils at a lower temperature at higher altitudes: there is less atmospheric pressure to get in the way of boiling\n\n### Atmosphere\nAs you go higher in the earth's atmosphere, there is less pressure due to the fact that there are fewer air molecules\n- air has mass, which is why there are more air molecules closer to the earth.

Imagine standing on a train platform, and throwing a ball at 30 km/h toward a train approaching at 50 km/h.

Because of the train's motion, however, that departure is at 130 km/h relative to the train platform; the ball has added twice the train's velocity to its own.\n- Translating this analogy into space: in the planet's frame of reference, the spaceship has a vertical velocity of `v` relative to the planet. After the slingshot occurs the spaceship is leaving on a course 90 degrees to that which it arrived on. It will still have a velocity of `v`, but in the horizontal direction. In the Sun reference frame, the planet has a horizontal velocity of `v`, and by using the Pythagorean Theorem, the spaceship initially has a total velocity of `√2v`.

The device feeds a known wattage current through the circuit and back into the device, and measures the volts that are received back into it. \n- level of resistance is measured in Ohms (Ω)\n\n### Semiconductor\n- Falling between a conductor and insulator, a semiconductor has the quality that it decreases in resistance as its temperature rises (opposite of metals).\n\n### Applications\nIncandescent lightbulbs (old-style)\n- these worked by having a filament with high resistance. The wire was so thin that the electricity has to fight to get through it, resulting in a lot of heat being given off, hence the name\n- This is similar to how toasters and kettles work. The idea is the same: shoot lots of electricity through an object with high resistance, causing it to heat up.\n\nAnalog Volume Knob (ex. radio)\n- The volume knob is actually part of an electronic component called a variable resistor. When you turn the volume down, you're actually turning up the resistance in the circuit that drives the radio's loadspeaker. With less current, there is less energy to power the loudspeaker.\n\n","n":0.056}}},{"i":76,"$":{"0":{"v":"Dreams","n":1},"1":{"v":"\ndrink 3 glasses of water before bed if you want to remember dreams because it causes you to wake up\n\nyou can influence your dreams by spending a lot of time doing a particular thing\n- ex. a group of people were asked to play Tetris all day for a week straight.

Imagine we have two containers of different sizes, but with the same amount of water vapour inside. The bigger container (or the more volumetric one) Will allow the water particles inside to have more states that they can possibly exist in.

If you are above or below another element in the table, you can make similar molecules with all the same other atoms. \n\nFor example, silicon is right below. So every molecule we can make with carbon can also be made with silicon\n- This is why many Sci-fi movies have life forms that are silicon based, rather than carbon based. This rationale is a bit weak however, since carbon is much more ubiquitous than silicon is.\n\n### Molecules\nIn a molecule, electrons are not confined to their own atoms. They can move around with ease if the right atoms are connected in the right way.\n- Sometimes the movements are so divisive as to polarize the molecule, and sometimes not quite so much that the molecule is not very polar at all. The important thing to keep in mind is that molecules will interact with each other depending on these degree of electrical interactions.\n- A lot of how a protein behaves is due to electrical interactions.\n\n### Protein\nEach protein is a molecule that is composed of chains of amino acids.\n- Using a particular set of atoms as building materials – which are carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and maybe a dash of sulfur – we can construct an amino acid. Start putting them together, and our chains will start to spiral and flatten due to electrical interactions between electrons that move around a molecule and expose positive regions.\n    - Chain enough amino acids and form enough spirals, and the result is an immensely complicated and massive molecule known as a [[protein|science.bio.proteins]].\n\n#### Baking example\nWhen mixing incredients for a cake, sometimes we have oil (large and electrically neutral) and water (small and highly charged). Naturally these 2 ingredients won't mix, but we can mix them if we add an egg. The reason this works is because of the egg's high protein content. \n- Proteins are amphiphilic, meaning that they have segments that prefer mixing with oil and segments that prefer mixing with water. When mixing an egg, the proteins start to unravel, scooping the ingredients in the water and the ingredients in the oil, creating one large oop.\n    - This property makes eggs an emulsifier, also known as a binding agent.","n":0.05}}},{"i":81,"$":{"0":{"v":"Carbon","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nCarbon is so necessary to life due to its remarkable capacity for forming chains and rings and other complex molecular architectures.\n\nCarbon enters the food web via photosynthesis when plants extract it from CO2 in the atmosphere. \n- All the carbon in the atmosphere ultimately comes from plants, and it is continually being recycled back into the atmosphere when we breathe out and die.\n\nMost of the carbon in the atmosphere's carbon dioxide is carbon-12, which is not radioactive.

These different instances are known as isotopes. \n- because different isotopes of an element are differentiated by their number of neutrons, therefore the atomic mass varies between these isotopes\n- ex. Carbon-12 is an isotope of 6 protons and 6 neutrons. Carbon-14 is an isotope of 6 protons and 8 neutrons\n\nSome isotopes are stable and some are unstable.\n- ex. Lead-202 is an unstable isotope, while lead-204, lead-206, lead-207 and lead-208 are stable\n\nUnstable means that the atoms spontaneously decay into something else at a predictable rate (though the decay occurs at unpredictable moments)\n\nAnother word for unstable is radioactive\n\nIn one kind of isotope instability, a neutron turns into a proton. This means that the mass number stays the same, but the atomic number goes up, so the atom becomes a different element.\n- in another type of radioactive decay, the opposite happens\n- Every unstable isotope decays at its own characteristic rate which is precisely known. \n- decay is exponential\n  - ex. Starting with 100 grams of a radioactive isotope, a fixed proportion of the remaining amount will decay. For example, if that proportion was 10%, then it would start at 100g, then 90g, then 81g, and so on.\n\n\n### Half-life\nThe favoured measure of decay rate is the half-life, which is the time taken for half of the atoms to decay \n- the half-life is the same, no matter how many atoms have already decayed (that is what exponential decay means)\n\nThe half-life of carbon-14 is between 5000 and 6000 years. Therefore, for specimens older than about 50,000 to 60,000 years, carbon dating is useless. \n- the half-life of rubidium-87 is 49 billion years; the half-life of fermium-244 is 3.3 milliseconds. Such startling extremes show us the stupendous range of clocks available. \n- potassium-40 has a half life of 1.26 billion years, and is therefore an isotope much used on the evolutionary timescale.\n\nAn isotope decaying means it turns into another element\n- ex. Potassium-40 has a half life of 1.26B years. One element below potassium is argon. If we start with some quantity of potassium, after 1.26 billion years, half of the potassium-40 will have decayed to argon-40. After another 1.26 billion years, half of what remains (ie a quarter of the original) will have decayed, and so on.\n- Therefore, we now understand how isotopes can be used as our clock. If we took a pound of potassium-40 and put it in a sealed box and waited for a few hundred million years, we would find that some proportion of those original potassium-40 atoms are now argon-40. By measuring the proportions, we can conclude how much time as elapsed.\n\n#### Link rot\nA 2003 study found that on the Web, about one link out of every 200 broke each week, suggesting a half-life of 138 weeks.","n":0.044}}},{"i":84,"$":{"0":{"v":"Bio","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nthe \"Frame Rate\" of the eye is often considered to be around 30 frames per second\n\nsex of a fetus is predetermined by the chromosomes in the sperm cell\n- The egg cell is always X.

[Up, car, sky, down]. Even though they are opposed, they are considered part of the same structure (see structuralism), and thus considered as closely related\n- this may have pervasive cultural influence, as people begin to think of the structure as binary (ie. If I'm not strong, then I must be weak)\n\n### Implicit and Explicit rules of the game\nThere are many different games we play throughout life. For each game, there are the rules we are \"told\" and are known by everyone. But also, there are the rules that are more scarce, and when their knowledge is possessed by people, it gives them an edge.\n\nTake a job interview for example. There are shared rules that we all know: make up a resume, give that resume to different companies to express interest in trading time/effort for money, and so on. We accomplish this by following a more granular set of rules, such as when to email the interviewer after an interview has taken place, or how to sign off on emails.\n\nIn addition to these common rules that we all share, there are more arcane rules that only the astute will have uncovered. It is well known in psychology that first impressions matter a great deal. This effectively becomes a rule in the game. If we are able to give off a better first impression, then we will heighten our chances of winning the game. The thing is, this part of the game effectively goes unmentioned. \n\nWhen evaluating the value of a single set of info (eg. A set of 10 high-value baseball cards), adding in 3 junk cards actually diminishes the value of the set. In other words, people put less value on it. However, when comparing 2 sets, one with the 10 cards, and the other with the 13, the second set is perceived as more valuable. This indicates that when left without anything to compare values to, the average is used (I'm 13 card set, value of each card drops, even though overall value rises) \n\nIt's a fundamental law. the more responsibility that is split among people the less that each person feels responsible for its outcome. \n\nWhen two things are compared, more (even if its broken dishes) will add value. However if there is no comparison (like a gift), items of cheap value added to the main gift will diminish its value\n\n* * *\n\nA good mood is a signal that things are generally going well, the environment is safe, and it is all right to let one’s guard down. A bad mood indicates that things are not going very well, there may be a threat, and vigilance is required.

A major event is supposed to have consequences, and consequences need causes to explain them\n- ex. Bond prices rise upon Saddam Hussein capture, or coincidence?\n- System 1 loves to invent [[narratives|psychology.narratives]]\n\n\"After spending a day exploring beautiful sights of new York, Jane suddenly realized that her wallet was missing\"\n- In surprise recall tests of this story, the word \"pickpocket\" was strongly associated with the story, even though it never appeared\n\nSystem 1 understands sentences by trying to connect the dots and make the story coherent. This resulting cogent story causes us to be gullible and believe too strongly in whatever we believe.\n- expl: If you can make a coherent story out of some percentage of the facts and fill in the gaps yourself, you are likely to believe it, because it makes sense. However, it did not necessarily happen this way, it's just a coherent story that is tricking you into thinking like that.\n- ex. There is a story about a man who went to visit a professor at his home. Outside the house the dog was playing on the lawn. When the professor open the door to let the man in, the dog ran into the house. Later the professor asked the man, do you always travel with your dog? The man replied, \"it’s not my dog. I thought it was yours\"\n    - this story demonstrates how System 1 is writing a narrative in the background without us even realizing it.\n\nWhen uncertain, System 1 bets on an answer, and the bets are guided by experience. The rules of the betting are intelligent: recent events and the current context have the most weight in determining an interpretation. When no recent event comes to mind, more distant memories govern. Among your earliest and most memorable experiences was singing your ABCs; you did not sing your A13Cs.\n\nBecause System 1 represents categories by a prototype or a set of typical exemplars, it deals well with averages but poorly with sums.\n\nYour emotional attitude to such things as irradiated food, red meat, nuclear power, tattoos, or motorcycles drives your beliefs about their benefits and their risks.\n\nSystem 1 generates impressions, feelings, and inclinations; when endorsed by System 2 these become beliefs, attitudes, and intentions\n\nSystem 1 understands sentences by trying to make them true, and the selective activation of compatible thoughts produces a family of systematic errors that make us gullible and prone to believe too strongly whatever we believe.\n\nYou surely understand in principle that worthless information should not be treated differently from a complete lack of information, but WYSIATI makes it very difficult to apply that principle. Unless you decide immediately to reject evidence (for example, by determining that you received it from a liar), your System 1 will automatically process the information available as if it were true. \n\n### System 1 is overconfident\nThe measure of success for System 1 is the coherence of the story it manages to create. \n- The amount and quality of the data on which the story is based are largely irrelevant. When information is scarce, which is a common occurrence, System 1 operates as a machine for jumping to conclusions.\n \nConfidence is a feeling, which reflects the coherence of the information and the cognitive ease of processing it.\n- In other words, confidence in a belief can be traced to two related impressions: cognitive ease and coherence\n- Put another way, confidence is a function of cognitive ease and coherence\n\n### How System 1 responds to statistics\nSystem 1 (your intuition) has no capacity to understand statistics. This is significant, because in events that require no statistical analysis, system 1 does well at connecting cause and effect (hitting egg with hammer). However, in understanding why rural states have higher incidences of kidney cancer, the mere statistics of having smaller sample sizes doesn't cross the mind of system 1. It looks for logical links and finds something else to explain the phenomenon.\n\nSystem 1 will pay attention to statistics if it offers a cause and effect type of answer to the question. this is why sometimes statistics will have an effect on answers.\n- ex. 85% of the cabs in the city are blue cabs in 15% are Green cabs. I told you that a Green cab rear ended me yesterday but my reliability is only 80%. In another scenario 85% of the blue cabs cause the accidents.\n\nSee how your impression of cause and effect changed the story and made it more clear what the cause was? this shows that people do indeed pay attention to base rates but only when it offers a cause-and-effect type of explanation.\n\nThis example also illustrates that there are two types of Base rates:\n1. statistical base rates - facts about a population to which a case belongs but are not relevant to the individual case. (Generally underweighted and sometimes neglected all together)\n2. causal base rates - change your view of how the individual case came to be. Creates a stereotype in your mind. (Treated as information about the individual case)\n\n### Intensity matching\n- This is a system 1 strength\n    - This is because people have an intuition for averages.\n    - ex. his hair is as long as she is tall. \n        - if a girl is 6'2\", then we know that is *unordinarily tall* for a woman. This causes us to approximate the length of the man's hair following a similar description, *unordinarily long*   \n    - Ex. Match the loudness of music to the brightness of a light\n    - Ex. Match the ability of a 4 year old to read fluently to the height of a male (ie. How tall would she be in terms of male height? 6'5\"?)\n    \nSystem 1 has more influence on behavior when System 2 is busy\n\nsome people are more like their System 2; others are closer to their System 1.\n\n# System 2\nSystem 2 works on data that is retrieved from [[memory|memory]] (ie. from system 1). System 2 is therefore susceptible to the biasing influence of [[anchors|self.bias.anchoring]] that make information easier to retrieve.\n\nA happy mood loosens the control of System 2 over performance: when in a good mood, people become more intuitive and more creative but also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors.\n\n### Analogy: System1/System2 as a caching system\nYou ask yourself a question like \"does my dad have integrity?\" And you immediately answer \"yea\", but this is just retrieved from your mental cache. If you do the actual network request maybe you’ll find a different answer\n","n":0.03}}},{"i":100,"$":{"0":{"v":"Stickiness","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n### Pomelos: Using Schemas to Aid in Explanation\n- explain what a pomelo is in 2 ways: \n  1.

At the very top are problems which give incentive for scientific research. Then you have meta analysis, systematic reviews, a whole bunch of individual studies, individual articles and more and more commercialized things which aren't scientific and oftentimes contain false information.\n- This can be linked to First Principles. Ideas that are \"closer to the metal\" are more likely to be quality and less likely to be watered down.

Wonder about the “how” rather than praising the “what.”\n- ex. Ask, \"how'd you think to create it like that?\"\n\n![[dendron://thoughts-on/relationships#^jIdd9KpwWdEcjyCO:#*]]\n\nThe parent is in charge of the decision, the child is in charge of his feelings\n\nWhen parental arguing is witnesses by a child, it’s not the argument that’s scary to them, as much as it is that no one talks to him about the argument he overheard.\n- A child cannot feel safe until he understands what’s happening around him. Avoiding talking to a child after an argument means that a child is left to his own devices to understand what happened; this is too much to manage, and a child will resort to self-blame to gain control.\n- When we give a child a story to piece things together, a child feels better because he can tell his alert system, “Now that I understand what happened and feel connected to my safe adult, I’m safe.” There are a few key elements to explaining your arguments to your child:\n\nIf you want to be an askable parent (ie. a parent who tells their kids \"you can talk to me about anything\"), you have to first model the behaviour by sharing with them. Tell them stories about your day, tell them stories about your past. Keep it mundane, but develop the habit of sharing personal information about yourself so that your child really feels like their is no barrier to be able to feel understood and unjudged.\n\n* * *\n\n### Fostering creativity in a child\nThe goal for parents shouldn’t just be creating spaces for free thinking, but defining those spaces. Give the kids the heavens, but tether them to Earth.\n- ex. Say it’s time for an art project and you’ve provided your kids with paints or colored pencils. Give your kids instructions to draw a sun. Then, excitedly say, “Let’s draw a weird-looking sun with clouds that block it!” or whatever you think is fun and creative. After some time has passed, say, “Let’s share our drawings at the same time!” When that happens, emphasize the originality of the child’s vision. Say, “Look at your sun! Your sun has black and green, unlike the sun in the sky, which is orange and yellow. That’s really great that you’re using your imagination!” By encouraging the kid not be literal, you’re giving the kid a space in which to be creative.\n\nModeling imagination requires that parents encour\n- ex. If you’re building something out of a plastic toy set, you might make a building out of it, but you can also ask your child, \"what is the strangest building we can possibly make? What would it look like?\"\n\n### Praise\nTo praise a child in a way that inspires behaviour change, it should contain all 3 elements:\n- it is emphatic. Big smile, use of the hands for emphasis. Loud cheery voice.\n- it should make mention of the thing that is being praised\n- non-verbal praise component, such as a high-five, a tassle of the hair, a hug etc.\n\nPraising an adolescent (ie. pre-teens and teens) should not be done in an effusive way. Also, the non-verbal praise component should involve no touching (e.g. thumbs up, air high five etc.)\n\nAlso, one should determine which action to praise beforehand. Focus efforts on one or two behaviours to change, and praise freely. \n- this makes you more likely to notice these behaviours in your child so are less likely to forget.\n\nPraise should be delivered right after the behaviour occurs\n\nGive even higher praise for behaviour that did not have to be preceded by a prompt (e.g. when you didn't have to ask your child to get dressed)\n\nLook for opportunities to mention the good behaviour that had occurred previously\n- ex. \"Wow! You got dressed right when I asked, just like you did yesterday!\"\n\nWhen using praise to shape behaviour, try to praise as many occurrences of the good behaviour that you can\n\nIf a target behaviour doesn't occur often, praise effusively when it does occur. Make a huge deal about it.\n- ex. \"I cannot believe you did that just like a big boy!\". If someone else is around, bring that person in the room tell the person all about the amazingly excellent behavior that you just saw. As the other adult enters the room, you could say, \"wait till you hear this! Big boy Caleb did exactly as I asked and right away, can you believe it?\"\n\n![](/assets/images/2023-01-13-21-25-59.png)\n\nIf the child doesn't co-operate with bigger tasks, get them to do minor things \n- ex. ask them to come and give you a hug, then praise \"great! you came over when I asked!\"\n- ex. if your ultimate goal is to get them to put their dishes in the dishwasher, start off by getting them to bring their cup to the sink and build up from there.\n\n#### Avoiding bad praise\nNever connect being a good child with the target behaviour\n- ex. \"John, you're a good boy because you cleaned your room like I asked\"\n\nNever connect your love/happiness for the child with the target behaviour\n- ex. \"You make mommy and daddy very happy by cleaning your toys\"\n\nNever deliver *cabooses* to praise\n- ex. \"Thank you so much for cleaning your room. **why can't you always just do it when I ask?**\"\n\nAvoid giving out vacuous and non-specific praise, as it will diminish the value of your good-quality praise. The art of delivering praise is just as much about what praise *not* to give.\n\n### When the child just won't listen\nThe first step is to try to eliminate the cloud of desperation hovering around the behavior. \n\ntell the child it is OK if she does not do the desired behavior, or, if it’s essential (bathing, for instance), if she does it superficially and minimally. \n\npractice nonchalance in talking about the behavior—a shoulder-shrugging, laissez-faire attitude of staged indifference.\n- ex. \"Don’t worry about this now; you will be able to do this when you get older,\" a pressure-reducing antecedent that can actually speed up compliance.\n- If this relaxation of the pressure leads the child to do the behavior on his own, the parents should maintain their guise of indifference.\n\t- In most contexts, effusive and enthusiastic praise is best, but this situation is different. Here, effusiveness has become associated with stress and implicit pressure, so instead we need some low-key acknowledgement—a simple \"That was good\" augmented by a nonverbal adjunct like a pat on the arm or the back of the head, all low-key and in passing.\n\nOffer a choice.\n- ex. \"can you put on your red coat or blue coat please?\"\n- ex. \"I can help you if you'd like\"\n\n## Adolescents\nWith a teenager, any effort to control or even influence facets of the adolescence life could be met with resistance and oppositional behavior\n\nCompromising and Negotating are 2 important tools toward developing your influence over the teenager.\n- Compromise refers to the outcome or actual solution that you reach\n- negotiation refers to the process of how to get there.\n\n### Compromise\nCompromising strengthens your rules in areas where you can't be open to compromise.\n\nA good rule of thumb is to err toward compromise on things that could be considered phases. Let your child do things that in a manner of 10 years, they would look back and deny that they ever did those things\n- ex. dying hair, dressing goth\n\n### Negotation\nThe opposite of negotiation would be doling out advice and making decisions without any real input from your teenager.\n\nlisten to what your adolescent says without jumping in, and withold judgements\n\nFocus on present and not what happened in the past\n- even if you are right, being right is jeoporadizing the process of negotiation. \n\nFinally, when it is your turn to talk, provide alternatives and suggestions for how to proceed with the situation. \n- Provide a number of options of how to proceed, that might include two or three possible solutions. \n- present them in a way that is not authoritative. \n\t- So try not to say anything like, \"Here's what you should do\" or \"this is what needs to happen\". Rather, leave with a sentence like, \"Here are some alternatives we might talk about\" or \"have you considered this or that?\" \n- the adolescent is much more likely to agree to one of your options or generate a compromise based on how you present the possible options and whether choices were involved.\n\nElements of effective negotation:\n1. select a time where there is no tension and no decision has to be reached at a particular moment.\n2. listen without jumping in. Be respectful of the teenager. Focus on the present and completely avoid bringing up what the teenager may have done in the past. \n3. Stay on topic\n4. offer possible suggestions when there is a disagreement.\n\nRemember to praise when the child exhibits the good behaviour as a result of the negotiation\n\n#### Initiating the negotation\nDon't be abrupt in bringing up the subject\n- ex. \"Can we talk about the cell phone problem?\"\n\t- bring it up in this way means \"I want to talk about something, and this is a problem\"\n\nBegin with the mindset, \"Here is why I need your help. I would like to reach a solution we can both live with regarding your cell phone use. You have one view, I have another. Let us find something we both might be able to live with and to do together. I know you want to use your cell phone all the time. It is important for me to understand more about this. Tell me how you see this.\"\n- after listening thoughtfully to them, say something like \"Here's my view. And let me say this even though you probably know what it is.\"\n\t- Here to the tone of how and what you say are even more important than the content to keep the negotiation going.\n\nWhatever you decide, this is a trial period, maybe for a week, and then you come together to see how it is going. This gives you and your teen a way out if some part of it is not working, or if there is some tinkering that needs to be done.\n\n### Problem-solving\n1. state the problem\n\t- ex. You might say, \"So Jack, is picking on you at recess.\" \n2. prompt and encourage the identification of potential strategies or solutions. \n\t- ex. So you say, \"What are some of the things you might do to handle that?\"\n3. identify two or three possible ways of handling the situation or general approaches to the problem\n\t- if your adolescent can take the lead on one of these that is better. We want to get them involved in the decision making process. It is imoprtant to not judge their strategy at this time.\n\t- ex. you might say, \"Well, one thing we could do would be to talk to the teacher. Is there something else we could do?\"\n4. go through each possible solution one at a time to identify what the consequences would be\n\t- ex. You say, \"Okay, one strategy is to go to the teacher. If you went to the teacher what would happen?\", and then prompt the same for the next strategy\n5. choose one of the solutions that is the best of the solutions based on the different consequences.\n\t- ex. You say, \"Okay, which seems to be the best solution?\"\n6. simulate\n\t- Try to make this fun and light.\n\t- ex. you and your teen actually role play the best solution. You as a parent play the bully and your child pretends to be himself in the situation and he acts out the best solution. Then you switch roles.\n\n\n# ABCs: Antecedents, Behaviour, Consequences\n- [source](https://www.coursera.org/learn/everyday-parenting)\nAll 3 are critical components to changing behaviour\n\nnote: the techniques described are tools that must be used together. One cannot expect results if they are just using one tool in isolation of others.\n- also, they must be used consistently. This is precisely why the first element of many of the tools is to \"define the behaviour you want to change beforehand\".\n\nThe tools described showcase examples that are fit for school-age children and younger, but the concepts apply equally well to a person of any age (including adolescents, and even adults). It is how the tools are applied that matters for their effectiveness per age-group\n\n## Antecedents\nantecedents are various things you can say and do *before* the behaviour, that increase the likelihood the behavior will occur.\n- ex. \"If you really loved me you would go to this family event with me.\"\n\t- A bad antecedent, but an antecedent nonetheless\n\nAntecedents must be combined with [[consequences|parenting#consequences]] in order for them to work, otherwise they won't do much to change a behaviour\n\nBehavior is heavily controlled by antecedents: whatever you do to set the stage for a behavior to prompt it to occur. \n\nThere are 3 types of ancetedents:\n- Prompts\n- Positive Setting Events\n- Negative Setting Events\n\n### Prompts\nTypes:\n- verbal, like \"go brush your teeth\"\n- physical, such as taking your child by the hand and leading them to the bathroom\n- visual, such as brushing your own teeth to show them how\n\nPrompts should be specific\n- ex. \"pick up all the clothes on the floor and put them in the hamper\" instead of \"clean your room\"\n\nIn the learning phase, prompts should ideally happen right before the desired behaviour is to occur\n- later on when the behaviour is well developed, you can start asking them to \"clean your room when you get home from school\"\n\nPrompts should be combined with *positive setting events*\n\nAs a rule of thumb, making the same request twice is fine, but more than that is nagging and should be avoided.\n- in this case, instead of nagging, go and help the child out. When you get a little bit of the good behaviour, praise it.\n\n### Positive Setting Events\nCalled \"setting events\" because they set the stage for the behavior you want.\n- We know that the same request may or may not lead to compliance based on how it is delivered.\n\nExamples:\n- tone of voice\n- formation of sentence\n- bending down to their level\n- whether or not a choice was presented\n\t- note: offer choices whenever possible\n- saying \"please\"\n- offering help to the child to start the behaviour\n- playful challenge, along with a mischievous look and pretend doubt\n\t- ex. With a playful smile, \"I'll bet you couldn't get your jacket and boots on in under 2 minutes! Only fully grown children can do that! You'd have to be a superhero to be able to do that.\"\n\t- ex. \"now Billy, it is probably too hard to do one more 'calm tantrum', and I'm not sure you're big enough to actually really do that\". Following that, \"no one on this planet could do it three times in a row, so let's not even try!\"\n\t- ex. \"Caleb, this might be hard to do. It’s something you will be able to do easily when you’re a bigger boy, but let’s try just for the heck of it.\"\n\n### Negative Setting Events\nNegative setting events are indirect antecedents that decrease the likelihood of a behavior, or increase some behavior you really don't want.\n- ex. using a harsh tone with your verbal prompt\n- ex. limiting your child's choice with certain phrases \n\t- \"do it because I said so\"\n\t- \"I'm the parent and you have to do this\"\n- ex. showing frustration\n\n### Antecedents practice\nIn front of a mirror, act as if you were giving the prompt to your child, and ask it in 3 different ways:\n- as you normally do\n- in a way with negative setting events\n- in a way with positive setting events\n\n### Jumpstarting\nSometimes getting the child to perform the behaviour is difficult because it seems insurmountable in their mind (e.g. starting a school project). We can take advantage of response [[priming|psychology.priming]] by sitting down with them and starting the project with you and working on it for just one or two minutes. \n- After the first step is completed, the child is allowed to stop. That is the critical part.\n\t- You may explicitly offer them the choice to stop the activity, or you may just choose to remain silent and see if they bring it up.\n\n### Consequence Sharing\nThe idea with *consequence sharing* is that if you have 2 children and want to correct a behaviour in just one of them (ie. the target child), you can offer a positive consequence for good behaviour that applies to both children, but only if the target child performs the good behaviour.\n- The reward could be points, or it could be much easier if you use a privilege, such as staying up 15 minutes longer for bed, or hearing a story.\n\t- Pick something that could be used each day.\n\nA benefit of consequence sharing is that siblings end up encouraging the child to do the behaviors often with very specific statements like \"do this, and I will help you\".\n\n### Group Program\nA slight alteration on *consequence sharing* is called a *group program*, where the difference is that **both** children must perform the specified positive behaviour.\n- this is the preferred way to handle this if both children have the same behavioural issue.\n\n## Behaviour\nThe question of interest is, \"how we design the situation to get the exact behaviors we want?\"\n\nShaping, Simulating, and Modeling are 3 different procedures for inspiring the child to partake in the behaviour.\n\n### Shaping\nShaping is rewarding small steps that begin to resemble the behaviour you want\n- the small step might even be a part of the process, rather than actually doing the behaviour\n\t- ex. if trying to get the child to eat vegetables, just get a small spoon of vegetables and put it to the child's lips.\n- ex. If you want child to do homework after school, start with 10 minutes and 4 days/week. Once that is consistent, you can gradually start to increase the amount.\n- ex. if you want the child to clear the table, start small. Get them to clear their plate and bring it to the sink. Praise effusively. After a few days of this, get them to start putting it in the dishwasher. Praise more.\n- ex. if you want your child to be downstairs ready by 8:00am on school days, break up the larger task of \"getting ready\" into smaller tasks that are easier to achieve. Consider even moving one component to the night before, such as packing the bag. This gives opportunity to deliver praise and makes for an easier transition the next morning since part of the job is already done, and the grand task doesn't seem so daunting.\n\nIf the child does not listen, stay positive with them. Say \"here, let me help you. We can do it together!\"\n\n### Simulating\nSimulation consists of making up practice opportunities to engage in the behavior in game-like, role-play and pretend situations. In other words, doing the behavior under artificial conditions.\n- One repeatedly practices the behavior under these artificial or pretend circumstances, the effect is to build a behavior, and the behaviors carry over to real situations, including those you wish to change.\n- here, *practice* refers to the behaviour that you want to occur\n\nSimulating can help both with getting the child to do things you want, as well as not do things you don't want\n\nFor simulation to be effective is not only what you do, but how you do it.\n\nyou should also make use of antecedents while explaining and doing the simulation.\n\nyou can use modeling to show the type of behaviour you'd like them to exhibit.\n\nPlay the simulation every day for maybe a week or so.\n\nIt's important to do the simulation at a time when there is no anxiety, tension or pressure.\n\nBe sure to praise the good behaviours that occur *outside* of the simulation\n\nSimulation actually combines a number of tools, including the use of antecedents, praise, point programs, and developing positive opposites. \n\nExamples:\n- play the *get ready for school* game on a Saturday or after dinner.\n- play the *going to bed* game in the morning\n\n![](/assets/images/2023-01-16-19-48-46.png)\n\n#### Example: Tantrum\n\"Go to the child and say Billy, I have a game I want to show you, it’s called the tantrum game. It's just pretend and here is how it works, I am going to tell you that you can't do something. I will say you can't watch TV tonight, but this is just pretend, you can really watch TV later, I just want to pretend that you can't do it. Billy, after I see you can't watch TV, it's your turn to have a pretend tantrum. You can say, no, you can get mad, you can fold your arms, but no hitting of mommy, no throwing things, and no shouting. You are just pretending to get mad.\"\n- when the child exhibits the correct behaviour, make sure to praise effusively.\n- after the simulation, offer a playful challenge that they can't do it again.\n\n### Modeling\nThink of modeling as teaching by example.\n\nModeling can be either accidental or deliberate\n- accidental: e.g. using swear words in your speech, reacting angrily at something small\n- deliberate: seeking out instances where you can model the behaviour\n\n1. Pick a bevahiour to model\n2. Think of instances that would demonstrate that behaviour\n3. Model the behaviour in real life\n\neven pointing out 3rd party modeling is beneficial, whether it is in-person or even on tv or a book.\n- ex. \"It's good that Sam was so loyal to Frodo, don't you think? Frodo knew he could count on Sam, and it turned out to be the sole reason they were able to succeed in the end\"\n\nModelling doesn't have to occur each day, but modelling instances are needed. \n\n![](/assets/images/2023-01-16-20-38-43.png)\n\n#### Example: Kindness\nSay you want to improve kindness in your child. First, you think of instances of that behaviour. \n- ex. helping other children, sharing things with other children, comforting someone in distress.\n\nLook for opportunities throughout the day to model behaviour that is indiciative of the change you want to make. Explain the action to your child after you've done it.\n- ex. \"I just gave this person some money for lunch because they did not have any\".\n\n## Consequences\n### Positive Opposites\nThis is an alternative technique to punishment for correcting bad behaviours.\n\nThe idea is to \"catch your child being good\".\n\n1. identify some behavior you want to reduce or eliminate in your child.\n2. identify what you'd like the child to do instead of that behavior (called the *positive opposite*, because it's the exact opposite of the behaviour you want to get rid of)\n\t- Sometimes it's the exact opposite and sometimes it's just a more appropriate behavior that you want in his place. \n3. praising the child when you catch them doing the positive behavior\n\nDeveloping the positive opposite puts the emphasis on replacing or building the behavior, and now will lead to a decrease in the behavior you want.\n\nExample behaviours and their positive opposites:\n- you want to get rid of your children fighting over a TV show.\n\t- opposite: Them sitting and watching TV together nicely\n\t- go to them and say, \"You two are playing so nicely. That's wonderful to see you get along so well!\"\n- you want to get rid of your child throwing his clothes all over the floor in his bedroom\n\t- opposite: Them placing them in his dresser or in the closet where you'd like them. \n- you want to get rid of your child getting out of bed again and again. \n\t- opposite: Them going to bed, maybe getting up no more than once and staying in bed. \n\t- \"It's so nice the way you went into your room and got ready for bed right away.\"\n- you want to get rid of your child shouting at you whenever you say no to something.\n\t- opposite: Them expressing anger calmly and doing what you asked.\n\nDue to negativity bias, it's difficult to notice your child's positive opposite behaviours. This is something that must be overcome to make effective use of positive opposites.\n\nAvoid focusing on the negative\n- ex. endlessly explaining to a child why their behaviour is wrong\n\n### Point Programs\nGive your child points for good behaviour, and allow them to spend those points on privileges/toys that they desire.\n\n5 ingredients are necessary:\n1. Specify the exact behaviours that earn points\n\t- ex. completing 15 minutes of homework \n\t- ex. putting your toys back into your room\n\t- ex. getting into bed by 8 p.m\n2. Choose a medium for disbursing the points\n\t- ex. checkmarks, stickers, tickets\n3. Devise a way to keep track of points earned and keep it visible for the child\n4. Specify how many points each behaviour earns\n5. Develop a reward menu, that specifies what the points can buy and what their costs are\n\t- consider having the child's input on what kind of rewards there can be\n\nit's important to have small rewards that can be bought right away without saving up.\n\nAvoid food rewards\n\nAt the end of each day or whenever convenient, choose a time when they can buy something.\n\nWhenever points are earned, make sure to praise so that the child knows exactly what they did to earn the star\n\nIf the child does not perform the desired behaviour, don't nag or show you are upset, but calmly state, \"You did not get a point today, but maybe you can earn one for that behavior tomorrow\".\n\nBehaviour outcomes should be as binary as possible\n- ex. either in bed by 8pm or not.\n\nDon't demand too much behaviour from the child to earn a point.\n- To build habits, we praise and give tokens for small bits of behavior.\n- we don't start off awarding points for 1 hour of homework, but we start out by giving points for 10 minutes of homework. From there, we can expand once the habit starts to take shape.\n\nIn the beginning, keep it simple, focus and try to change one or a maximum of two behaviors but no more\n- Once the behaviors develop consistently, you can stop giving points and praise for that and replace it with another behavior. \n\ndo not give points for long-term outcomes. \n- ex. the program will not work if you say if you get good grades, I'll give you a car.\n\nPoint systems have the added benefit of helping the parents be more consistent, since the scoreboard serves as a cue to deliver praise more systematically.\n\nIf you are taking a vacation, consider having an isolated point program just for that trip, especially if you don't already do point systems at home.\n\n### Attending & Planned Ignoring\nAttending and planned ignoring can be effective techniques with adolescents.\n- try your best to ignore the bad behaviours your adolescent exhibits, and focus on *positive opposites* to modify behaviour.\n- a good indication that you should be using strategic attending and ignoring is that you complain about how difficult it is sometimes to interact with your adolescent. Pay special attention to opportunities of positive conversations around the house, while on an errand, or in the car, or comments about his or her school day. \n\t- tip: think of these situations beforehand so you are more aware when they do occur.\n\n#### Attending\nAttending is noticing when someone is doing some behavior that you wish to increase and then providing attention by praising, smiling, asking pleasant questions, talking nicely, hugging or giving the child a pat on the back.\n- the effects of giving attention can be both positive or negative\n\t- negative - if our child is continuously complaining about a chore they have to do, it can have a detrimental affect if we stop and continuously explain single time.\n\nNaturally, negative events tend to draw our attention more that positive ones\n- ex. Consider that when 2 children are playing together nicely, we tend to leave them alone. When they start fighting, that is when we *attend* to them.\n\nThe effectiveness of attending depends on four conditions:\n1. define the behavior you want to increase\n2. decide on the type of attention you're going to use\n\t- ex. give praise, give acknowledgement (\"I noticed you brushed your teeth without us even having to ask!\")\n3. ensure the attention is given directly after the behaviour.\n4. attend to the behaviour often\n\n#### Planned Ignoring\nPlanned ignoring is when you deliberately don't give attention to a behaviour.\n- ex. don't look at them, talk to them, start talking to another person etc.\n\nThe effectiveness of planned ignoring depends on four conditions:\n1. define the behavior you will be ignoring\n2. decide which kind of planned ignoring to use when that behavior occurs\n3. try to be consistent and use planned ignoring whenever that specific behavior occurs that you wish to decrease.\n4. be sure to attend to the positive behavior, since planned ignoring not effective by itself and must be coupled with attending\n\t- this is necessary, because we need a positive behaviour to replace the negative behaviour.\n\nConsistency is key when it comes to correcting a behaviour via planned ignoring. Even if you are successful 90% of the time ignoring the behaviour, it will be that 10% probability that the child will be motivated by, and the behaviour will persist.\n- this same effect is present in gambing psychology, where when a reward occurs once in a while and is unpredictable, behaviour can persist for a long time.\n\nBehaviours tend to get worse when starting a planned ignoring routine. This only lasts for a few days, and should be followed by improved behaviour thereafter. Try your best to ignore the increase intensity.\n\n### Punishment\nVery mild and brief punishment can be helpful when that punishment is a supplement or a minor part of a larger program to reinforce behavior. However, the emphasis has to be on the *positive opposite*.\n\nSteps to effective punishment:\n1. decide the behavior you want to decrease.\n2. decide the behavior you would like to replace that other behavior (ie. *positive opposite*) so that you can attend to and praise it.\n3. decide how you will reward that new behaviour\n4. decide on the punishment that will be used. It should be mild and brief, since more intense punishments have shown to be no more effective, and also bring out more negative side-effects.\n\t- the punishment should be determined ahead of time to avoid impromptu punishments, since impromptu punishments tend to be long and severe\n\t- ex. time out from reinforcement, loss of a privilege for a short period of time, loss of points if you're using a point program, or even a mild reprimand.\n5. make sure instances of the praise greatly outnumber the instances of the punishment.\n\t- ex. if you gave your child time out four times this week, it would be critical to administer attention for the *positive opposite* at least twice as many times.\n\nThree main types of punishment\n1. presenting something undesirable or negative after a behavior. In each case, the child does the undesirable behavior and something is presented.\n\t- ex. reprimands, shouting, or hitting a child. \n2. taking away something positive after a behavior. \n\t- ex. taking away an activity, a privilege, or some planned positive event, give time out. In point programs, taking points away for some misbehavior would be another example\n3. requiring some effort or some task that has to be performed. This usually consists of using a chore or cleaning up something as a penalty. \n\t- ex. if a child breaks something, he would have to clean up the mess as the penalty or work on some other chore.\n\nTraditional punishment is not very effective for developing behaviours, nor eliminating negative behaviours.\n\nNegative side-effects of punishment\n1. emotional reactions on the part of the child who is punished. This may include crying, arguing, or even striking a parent.\n2. escape and avoidance. When a parent delivers more punishment than praise, children often try to distance themselves from the person who punished them. \n\t- Consider that the punishment you give may be creating a negative association that we want to avoid.\n\t\t- ex. when punishment consists of extra homework, staying after school, and even exercising, that creates a negative association for the child. This is something we must be careful to avoid.\n3. an increase in aggressive behavior. When a person punishes, the child is more likely to retaliate by hitting the punisher. This is especially likely when the punishment involves physical contact in some way.\n\t- ex. if a parent uses hitting as a form of punishment, that'll lead to aggression and teach them to punish their peers in the same way.\n\t- ex. if the parent tries to physically force or take a child to time out\n\n#### Timeout from Reinforcement\nTime out consists of a brief period of time in which the child does not have access to the usual rewards in the situation\n- ex. the rewards might be just being in the presence of others, receiving parent, teacher or peer attention, or participating in some activity or game that is going on\n\nDuring time out, there is no talking or playing with the child.\n\nThe place of timeout must not be somewhere where the child can not have fun or find interesting things.\n\nTimeouts have nothing to do with thinking about what they did wrong— they are about withdrawing attention for a period of time.\n\nIt is not necessary to send the child to their room; even having them stay in the same room that the negative behaviour occurred in is fine\n\n\"reinforcement\" is a technical term for *rewards*\n\nThere are five ingredients for using time out. \n1. decide exactly what behavior will serve as the basis for asking the child to go to time out.\n2. determine the *positive opposite* behaviours, and praise when they occur\n\t- without this, positive behaviour change will not occur\n3. decide what and where this timeout will occur.\n4. decide how long timeout will last (1-5 minutes is sufficient)\n\t- longer tiemouts are not more effective\n5. have a backup punishing event (preferably loss of privilege) that will be used if the child refuses to go to timeout.\n\t- the punishment should not exceed 24 hours\n\t- ex. \"if you do not go to timeout now, you will lose your tv privilege for tonight. You have a choice.\". Give them 30 seconds or so, and if they still refuse, deploy the punishment, and simply walk away without arguing\n6. explain how timeout works to your child while everyone is calm and happy. Simulate to the child what it is like when getting a timeout (again, while everyone is calm any happy).\n\nNever\n1. physically bring your child to timeout\n\t- physical contact during punishment leads to aggressive behaviour\n2. lock a child in the room\n3. give more than a couple warnings about going to/staying in timeout.\n\n## Avoid\nSome general things to avoid:\n- when a child is angry, don't get them to talk about their anger\n\t- talking about aggression will not reduce aggressive behaviour, and may in fact increase it.\n\n* * *\n\n## Playful parenting\nWhen everything is going smoothly, playful parenting is about having fun together. The rest of the time, it's about drawing children out of their isolation. Play is a child's natural way of recovering from their daily emotional upheavals. Therefore, the better we are at playing with a child at their level, the better we'll be at helping them reconnect to us.\n- reconnection might be as simple as making eye contact with a baby just after their outburst has subsided.\n\nIt’s the parents job to seek out the connection, but the child’s job to set the terms on how they are going to connect\n\nKids wants to relieve their frustration through play. When they get a needle at the doctor, they feel frustrated and powerless and the first thing they want to do when they get home is play doctor. Be the patient for them\n\nThere are four circumstances when children need more active participation from adults:\n1. When they are having a difficult time, connecting with peers or adults.\n2. When they seem unable to play freely and spontaneously.\n3. When things are changing in their life, such as the start of kindergarten, the birth of a new sibling, a death or divorce in the family.\n4. When they are in danger.\n\nIt’s when kids need parental attention the most that we are least equipped to give it to them\n- kids need us when they are not connecting well with their peers (or us). This normally makes us feel sad, mad, bored or irritable, rather than playfully attentive. \n- kids need us when they are going through transitions. But transitions are difficult for adults too. When we go through transitions, we have even less attention for our kids.\n\n### Universal Translator\nWe need to be able to properly tune in to our children's behaviour, taking any troubling, annoying or infuriating words/action from our toddler, decoding it, and then responding to the decoded version of what their words/actions mean.\n\nex. a child walks into the classroom and hits his favourite teacher and then runs under the table\n- *the translation*: \"I want to get close to you, but closeness is scary for me. Besides, I'm angry and you probably hate angry kids, so I'll hate you first\"\n- *the thoughtful response*: \"You know, I wonder if you hit me and then run under the table because you kind of want to get close to me, but you're kind of not sure. How about if we shake hands or give each other a high five whenever you come into the room?\"\n\nex. a child says \"this homework is stupid\"\n- *the translation*: I'm frustrated because I haven't mastered fractions yet. Can you help me?\"\n- *the thoughtful response*: \"I'd love to help you with fractions\"\n\nex. a child says \"I hate you\"\n- *the translation*: \"I haven't figured out yet how to be mad at someone I love; it's confusing\"\n- *the thoughtful response*: \"I love you, and I get confugsed too when I'm mad at someone I love\"\n\nWe need to remember to use this translator especially at times when our childrens behaviour seems to make no sense.\n\n## Resources\n- https://centerforparentingeducation.org/","n":0.012}}},{"i":112,"$":{"0":{"v":"Attachment","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nAttachment is about forming strong relationships with the child so they can feel comfortable leaning on you while they develop\n\nAs children begin to feel safe and settled in the world that surrounds them, and at the same time come to understand subconsciously that their big people are moving quietly and persistently on their behalf to ensure this happens, their regulatory systems settle, Leading them to more likely keep their reactions in check when situation escalates. \n\nThere are 3 situations that will trigger the child’s attachment system\n1. When they are sick\n2. When they are physically hurt\n3. When they are emotionally hurt\n\nFor the first 2, parents generally respond well, giving connection that the child desires.

We automatically orient ourselves by seeking cues from those we are attached to.\n- Children can not be oriented toward parents and their peers simultaneously, since each provides a conflicting direction. \n\n### Connection\nConnection through relationship grows the foundational core of the brain and governs the regulatory state of the growing child\n- A solid relationship leads to a more regulated brain, and a more regulated brain leads to a more subtle child, which allows for neurological and emotional connections to take root and eventually lead to true maturity\n- Therefore, the relationship must be guarded above almost all else. Avoid doing things that harm the relationship, and never do things that lead the child to think you are not the \"end all be all\" for them.\n\nWhen a child is mad, you must show them that they are heard\n- \"Hey man, you seem really mad right now. I get that. It's frustrating when you're in the middle of building your lego tower and something like dinner has to interrupt that. I get it. That's frustrating!\"\n- \"You called me a bad dad. I get why you might feel that way.\"\n    - notice that here we are simply acknowleding— not agreeing.\n\nCome alongside your child to get them onside\n- connect with them before asking them to do something. Instead of just saying, “go upstairs and do the laundry”, first connect with them in a way that says “I see you”. Comment on the Lego structure they are building. Comment on their choice of clothes for the day. Ask a question about the game they are currently engaged in.\n- what we are doing here is organically priming their brain to be on our side, which increases the likelihood of compliance. \n\nAs adults, we have this tendency to respond to our child’s fears, disappointments, and otherwise unhappy moments without a passionate understanding. Consider that it is easier to empathize with an adult than it is a child. When our friend loses a loved one, it's easy to put ourselves in their shoes and show them true empathy. As the listener, we manifest this empathy by giving them a sympathetic ear, looks of support and a calm gentle tone of voice. However, it is quite another matter to empathize with children. We might think it's cute when they tell us about a nightmare they had where their broccoli was eating them. We don't intuitively understand their fears, because to us it's not a frightening experience.\n- Consider the same point for other emotions, like frustration. Most adults wouldn't find it overwhelmingly frustrating if the ice cream parlour was out of our favorite flavour, so we don't naturally have empathy for our child who does indeed feel overwhelmed by their frustration and anger.\n\nNever use the idea of connection as a bargaining chip\n- ex. When you give your child a timeout because they are not behaving, you are implementing the idea that “if you don’t behave, you will lose the positive attention from me”. \n    - the child has a foundational need for connection, and in our example, it is only being conditionally met. That is, the child only achieves it based on some condition. So we essentially are bullying them into acting a certain way in order to get that connection.\n\nOur goal as parents is to gift our children as many opportunities as possible (especially challenging moments) to affirm their safety through an unconditional connection to us.\n\n### Boundaries\nSet intuitive boundaries for your child\n- anal: Consider the guard rails of a bridge. For the vast majority of cases, they do nothing to actually prevent disaster. They do however, provide a sense of safety.\n\nIt is important to provide boundaries for your children, but not in a way that if they cross those boundaries, we react negatively. A child needs to feel that those boundaries exist, yet we as the parent need to know when to allow those boundaries to be moved a little. In these cases, we need to get ahead of it and not allow the child to cross the boundary themselves, but offer them the opportunity to cross the boundary.\n- ex. Imagine we set our children up for soccer lessons, and they had agreed to go every Tuesday and Thursday. This is a commitment, and a clear boundary to what they are expected to do. However, there will be times when the child feels overwhelmed and on able to participate in the lesson. It is not up to us to ensure that the child goes to in the lesson. We should be attuned to our child’s emotions, and offer them the opportunity to skip the lesson for that day, should the child need it. This needs to be done in a way that shows we are in charge and that we are making the decision, based on their feelings (\"I can see that today feels like a really tough day. Let's skip soccer practice and go get some ice cream instead.\"). Notably, we get ahead of it before our child asks us if they can skip the soccer lession that day.\n\nDon’t explain the rationale for boundaries in the moment. Wait until later once the child has excepted the boundary, they are emotionally settled, and you have engaged the child in a moment of connection.\n- ex. Before dinner, your child asks if they can have a cookie. You say \"no\". Their response is, \"why?\" Once you say something like \"because it will spoil your appetite\", you open them up to engage in a boundary dispute with you. Instead, simply say \"we will talk about that later. The answer is no\"\n\nLet your child’s needs inform your decisions, but always make it seem like you are in charge.\n- ex. You may typically not have cookies before dinner, you may recognize that your child has had a very hard day, and you denying her the cookie before dinner will lead to a meltdown. So when she asks for the cookie, you say “I was just about to say let’s have a dessert first kind of night!”. That way, the child doesn’t think they had any influence on the boundary, but they still get the connection from us.\n\nImagine a scenario where you have already said no to what your child has requested, but after some back-and-forth, you realize that your child really needs this and it’s not worth the impending meltdown if you stick to your guns. Find a way to not allow your child to think they influenced the boundary, but still give them what they want. \n- ex. Your child’s typical routine is that after dinner, they get to watch one episode of their favourite show. After the episode has finished, your child asks for one more. Sticking to your guns, you say no. Then you can sense that because your child has had a hard day, they start to argue back. At this moment, you realize that the connection gained from allowing them to have one more episode is worth it. But instead of saying something conciliatory like “ok honey you were right, you can have one more show”, find a way to exit the loop gracefully. Say something like “you know what, I just realized I left the sprinkler on outside. Give me a few minutes, and we’ll talk a little later. In the meantime, enjoy your show”.\n\n### Dependence\nYour child needs to feel that they can depend on you no matter what. Don't get caught up in the trap of making them do things on their own that they should know how to do already.\n- ex. if they are asking you to help put their jacket on, you are not harming their quest to independence by helping them. In fact, you are supporting their intuiting that they can rely on you for anything, allowing them to grow in their own time when they are ready for it.\n\nAs a parent, your job is to demonstrate that you are in charge. This means showing that you understand them, understand the greater situation, and understand what needs to be done. You must avoid showing them that you don't understand something, or that some situation is out of your control. This is what causes your child to have confidence in you and allows them to depend on you.\n\nDemonstrate a confidence to your child that shows them that you are in charge and that you understand them and their needs\n- if possible, avoid having to ask them questions around why they need your attachment, and just give it. Demonstrate to them that you already \"get it\", without even having to be asked.\n- take charge when you can sense that your child is feeling vulnerable. Take their hand, instead of asking and explaining: \"can you give me your hand, because...\"\n\nYour role as the parent is to provide a safe space from which the child can explore. That is, you want them to feel they can depend entirely on you, so they can grow into their role as an independent person on their own time.\n- There will be dips in this progress toward independence. For example, a break in the child's routine or them being sick may cause them to \"regress\" and seem more dependent on you. Allow them to do this. \n\nA child's dependence on the parent is key, because it allows them to go through the normal, healthy emotional processes that come when dealing with upsetting emotions (like disappointment), and then experience what it is to grieve and recover, which helps them develop resilience along the way.\n- if you are not a figure upon which they can depend, the child will become highly distressed and tend towards dissociation, resulting in them turning off their feelings to avoid the ongoing pain whenever their true needs are not met.\n\n### Mountain\nWhen confronted with unwanted negative behaviour in a child, a parent will tend toward either: firmness or appeasement.\n- *firmness* - putting up clear boundaries and stating expectations and not letting up\n- *appeasement* - becoming a people pleaser and offering to make amends\n\nThe more we stay in whichever tendency we veer towards, the closer we get to either a bully (in the case of firmness) or a jellyfish (in the case of appeasement). As we get closer down the mountain on either side, it's ever more important to find our way to the other side.\n- ex. if we have a tendency toward firmness, then after we have been firm for a while, we need to go on the side of appeasement. This might mean that shortly after the confrontation, we suggest to the child to go do something they love to do. \"Hey buddy, how about we go out for a bike ride?\". This shows the child that we still love them and that nothing has damaged the bond between you and your child.\n\n### Tantrums\nWhen a child is throwing a tantrum and breaking things, we should prevent them from breaking those things (preferably without resorting to grabbing them to prevent them). \n- ex. if they are banging dishes around, put your hand between the dish and the table. Give them validation on their feelings (\"I can see you're really mad right now. I get that\")\n\nWhen a child is throwing a tantrum, don't put up a barrier of resistance. Instead, offer validation. If you put up resistance to a negative behaviour, you are making them push back on it. If you instead offer validation and understanding, they have nothing to push back on and eventually fall into you.\n\n### Analogy: Filling and refilling a cup\nThe primary caregiver is a child’s reservoir. The child’s need for attachment with them is like a cup that is emptied by being hungry, tired, lonely or hurt. The cup is refilled by being loved, fed, comforted and nurtured.\n- playing and chit chatting when the child is happy also refills the cup.\n- as children get older, just thinking about their caregiver can fill the cup. In fact, securely attached children can get their cup refilled from friendships, from having fun, or from learning something new and interesting at school.\n- some children demand constant topping off of their cup, coming to adults for the smallest of things– such as tattling on their playmates. If their cups aren’t totally full they go into a panic.\n- some children need a refill but aren’t able to get it. They lock the caps on their cups so they won’t lose the little that is left, but then close themselves off from getting a refill easily. Lacking confidence in the refilling process, they might refuse a hug, or refuse to go to bed, or refuse to sit and eat dinner. \n\nIt’s helpful to look at a child’s behaviour through the lens of the state of their cup, especially when they are approaching empty. When they are bouncing off the walls and not listening, think of them as racing around trying to desperately refill their cups.\n\n* * *\n\nChildren with secure attachment can soothe themselves, can handle their emotions, pay attention, connect well with peers, and feel good about themselves and the world.\n\nThe key to secure attachment is responsiveness– a sensitive response to the child’s needs by the caregiver.\n\nMirroring is a perfect connection game: just do exactly what the child does. If a baby is looking at you with a serious face, look back at them with the same expression. If your kid is shaking his leg in an anxious way, start shaking your leg in the same way.\n- mirroring creates a moment of closeness and deeply felt connection\n- It’s important to make sure you don’t make them feel mocked.

If you had a calorie goal of 2000 per day, then of those 2000 calories, somewhere between 680-800 of those calories would be for protein (since protein has 4 calories per gram)\n\n### Fat\nWhen we consume fats, it prioritizes its energy on keeping hormones in balance, absorbing essential nutrients, and to protect our organs.\n\nSome common signs that we need more fats in our diet are constant hunger, feeling cold, exhaustion, mood swings, and dry skin.","n":0.05}}},{"i":114,"$":{"0":{"v":"Notetaking","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# E Resources\n- [PARA method of notetaking (projects, areas of responsibility, resources, archive)](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/)\n- [Nikita blog: Everything I know (a blog used as a memex)]\n\n# UE Resources\n- [Second brain article](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/)\n","n":0.186}}},{"i":115,"$":{"0":{"v":"Network Effects","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\nin situations where there are network effects that are supplied by many different companies, innovation is stymied by the network dependence that manufacturers have on each other\n- ex. in the custom PC industry, the network effects created by different manufacturers having to create an end product that is compatible with other parts creates a gravitational pull that forces manufacturers to continue to make products that follow the standards set out by other companies in the other parts of the supply chain\n","n":0.111}}},{"i":116,"$":{"0":{"v":"Music","n":1}}},{"i":117,"$":{"0":{"v":"Theory","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n## Ratios in music\nMusic is all about ratios\n\nThe choice of 12 semitones per octave comes from the fact that going up 12 \"perfect fifths\" (3:2 ratio) is almost exactly the same as going up 7 octaves (2:1 ratio)\n- the chromatic semitones are equally spaced by have each note be the same ratio higher than the preceding note, so that the product of 12 of these ratios equals 2:1 (octave) exactly. \n  - Mathematically this ratio is the twelfth root of 2.\n\n## Tonic\nMusic is built around the tonic. Some notes are ok with being away from the tonic, but others give a strong push towards ending up at a tonic. Notably, the leading tone of a scale wants to point back to the tonic. If the tonic is the most grounded note of the spectrum, then the leading tones serve to add gravity to the music.

All that's to say is that chromatic refers to the notes/chords that don't belong (ie. not diatonic).\n\n### Diatonic\nWhen we say something is \"diatonic\", we say that it belongs in the context. In other words, it belongs in the scale we are currently in.\n- ex. In the key of Cmaj, the notes that are diatonic are C D E F G A B\n- anal: the letter `e` is diatonic to the English language, but `é` is not\n  - notable in this analogy is that there is nothing wrong with using non-diatonic letter in English, as in the word \"naïveté\".\n\nA diatonic scale is a subset of a chromatic scale, since all notes of a diatonic scale exist in the corresponding chromatic scale.\n\n### Pentatonic\nA pentatonic scale has 4 notes\n- spec: they are major scales without the 4th or 7th scale degrees\n\nThe major penatonic is the major scale with most dissonant notes (4th and 7th removed)\n- `I-ii-iii-V-vi`\n\nThe tone that points least strongly to the tonic is the fifth scale degree, G in the C major scale, and it points least strongly because it is perceived as relatively stable;\n\n### Blues\nThe blues scale is a pentatonic scale with an added `♭V`.\n\n## Scale Degrees\n### Subtonic\nThe degree of a scale that is a whole step below the tonic.\n- thus, in a major scale it is non-diatonic, as the 7th is only a half step below the tonic, making the subtonic a flattened 7th.\n- in a natural minor scale is it diatonic.\n\n## UE Resources\n- [Scales: Why They Matter and How to Practice Them](https://www.tuneupgrade.com/TheBeat/scales-why-they-matter-and-how-to-practice-them)\n- [Reference songs for interval recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_recognition)","n":0.048}}},{"i":120,"$":{"0":{"v":"Minor","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nIt's not that there are 3 different minor scales; it's that there are 3 variations of the same scale.\n- that is, some notes of the minor scale may be changed around to achieve some kind of melodic harmony.\n- note: that there are other forms of minor scales too.

C-E♭-G-B♭\n\n## Harmonic minor\nThe major scale features a half-step between the 7th and 8th notes of the scale. This interval has a sort of tension-resolution effect. On the other hand, the natural minor scale doesn't have this same feature, since there is a whole step between the 7th and 8th scale degrees. \n\nThis is why the harmonic minor scale exists: it allows us to add that tension-resolution interval to the minor scale. The only difference between it and the natural minor is the raised 7th.\n- As a result, when playing in a minor scale, the 7th is only really sharpened when we are going for that tension-resolution effect.\n\nThe only difference from the natural minor is that the 7th is sharpened, giving us a leading tone, making it want to point back to the tonic\n\nChords that sound nice with the scale:\n- `minMaj7` (minor 3rd, major 7th)\n  - ex. C Eb G B\n  - this can be used as the `i`\n  - this works because the chord is formed by the `i`, `iii`, `v` and `vii` degrees of the harmonic minor scale.\n- `dim`\n  - can be extended by adding a minor 7th (`D°⁷`/`Dmin7♭5`)\n\n## Melodic minor\nA problem arises with the harmonic minor: the interval between the 6th and 7th scale degrees is 3 semitones, which is rather large.\n- ex. in A harmonic minor, this interval is `F`-`G♯`\n- To compensate, we can simply raise the 6th so that the interval is only a major 2nd\n  - doing this creates a smoother melody when we are leading towards a tonic.

Notice how the notes that are opposite to each other in the circle are a tritone(three whole tones) apart. C and F# are opposite to each other and they are a tritone apart on the piano. G and Db are a tritone apart and they are opposite each other on the circle and so on.\n- a way to better recall this is to remember 4 notes on the circle. C,G,F# and F. C is at the top, F# is at the opposite side of C, G is to the right of C, and F is to the left of C. And then, just remember BEAD. On the right side of the circle, BEAD goes up from F# and goes till G, and to the left BEAD goes down from F and goes down to F#. The only difference is that BEAD on the left is all flat, Bb,Eb,Ab,Db.\"\n\n\"Another point: when you look at the key of C, you actually see a family of chords related to that key, right next to each other which represents the \"qualities of C\". Thus you have your IV, I and V chords right next to C, but then you also have the chords D, A and E, looking to the right, (which in this case would be the relative minors of F, C and G...Dm is the relative minor of F, Am is the relative minor of C, and Em is the relative minor of G.

It doesn't always feel immediately obvious, particularly if you are in a complex major key at the time, so just move clockwise by three (G major -> E minor). Similarly if you are in a minor key and want the associated major, go anticlockwise by three (D minor -> F major).\"","n":0.036}}},{"i":128,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chords","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nA chord (in a *tertian harmonic* sense; ie. harmony built on thirds) must have all of its notes a third apart (either minor or major)\n- this rule holds true for extended chords (e.g. `9th`, `11th` chords), since the 9th is a minor third above the 7th, \n\nchords are often augmented with \"tensions\". A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively dissonant interval in relation to the bass.\n- Harmonization usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between consonance and dissonance. Simply put, this occurs when there is a balance between \"tense\" and \"relaxed\" moments. \n- A misplayed note or any sound that is judged to detract from the whole composition can be described as disharmonious rather than dissonant. \n\nThink of a chord as a harmonic structure that supports melody\n\n### Augmented\nAugmented chords can be used as a substitute for a dominant chord.\n\nAugmented can be used to increase the tension of the V chord, before bringing it back to the tonic, creating an even bigger resolution.\n\nExamples:\n- Oh! Darling - Beatles (opening chord)\n\nIf you take a minor triad and augment the 5th you wind up with a major triad of the augmented note\n- ex. Gm with an augmented 5th yields an E♭ major chord.\n\n### Add chords\nAn add chord simply adds the scale degree to the chord\n- ex. a C6 chord is a Cmajor with the 6th\n\n`add` chords notably don't remove the 3rd, making `add2` and `add4` chords distinct from `sus2` / `sus4`\n\nTry arpeggiated `add♯4` and let the bass drive the progression.\n- Lydian\n\nTry arpeggiated `addb2` and let the bass drive the progression.\n- Phrygian\n\n### Extension chords (compound intervals)\n- ex. 9th, 11th, 13th\nThey are called compound because they are greater than one octave\n\nCompound chords are normally played with the 7th.\n- this is the principal difference between an `add2` chord and a `9th` chord\n\n### Augmented 5th (aka minor 6th)\nArpeggiated, provides a mysterious vibe\n\n### Slash chords (e.g. `C/E`)\nA slash chord denotes which note should be played in the most bass register\n- ex. if we have a `C/E` chord, we should play a C major chord with notes `E`/`G`/`C`.\n\nIf the slash chord contains a note not found in the chord (e.g. `C/B`, since `B` is not part of C major), then we have to reconstruct the chord. In this case, a `C/B` chord is a `Cmaj7` chord with `B` in the lowest register.\n\n* * *\n\n### The Four Chords (I-V-vi-IV)\nThey work well together because they offer a lot of space to work with.

From there I narrow it down. I use \"r\" key for previous take and \"t\" key for next take. I have \"1\" set to go to start of loop. In this way I can comp vocals super fast without looking at the keyboard, as my left hand has all the relevent keys within reach. I also use \"v\" for reduce current take volume by 1db, and \"b\" to increase current take by 1 dB, for evening out levels quickly without automation.\n- custom action: Transport: Stop...

It can\n- Generate sound waves of different shapes.\n- Generate more than one sound tone at once to produce a fundamental frequency and harmonics.\n- Make the volume of the sound change over time to produce different sound envelope shapes (ie. attack, decay, sustain, release).\n\nTo do this, the synthesizer has a number of different voices or oscillators (sound tone generators), each of which can produce waves of different shapes (sine wave, square wave, saw tooth, triangular wave, and so on)\n- these waves can be combined to make complex sounds\n\nSounds on a synthesizer can be made in either an additive or subtractive way\n- anal: consider that art can be made by combining different elements (additive), or it can be made by removing the parts that don't belong, like a block of marble (subtractive)\n- the subtractive method is much more common, meaning we start with a complex sound, filter it to remove harmonics, and envelope shape its volume.\n\nModulation refers to how the sound of the synth changes\n- ex. one way to modulate the sound is by manipulating the pitch envelope. another way is to adding an LFO.\n\n### Subtractive Synthesis (most common)\nSubtractive synthesis is so-called because the approach is to take a raw soundwave sound, and alter its timbre by applying a filter.\n\na simple subtractive synthesizer makes sound using four independent components:\n1. An oscillator generates the original sound (and you can control it in various ways), which will be a mixture of a fundamental frequency and its harmonics. Most synthesizers have at least a couple of oscillators.\n2. A filter cuts out some of the harmonics (for example, by boosting or cutting all harmonics above a certain frequency).\n3. An amplifier changes the volume of the sound over time, according to ADSR values that you set (as we discussed above).\n4. A second, independent oscillator, known as an LFO (low-frequency oscillator), can be used to vary how the previous three stages work, producing some very interesting effects. For example, if you apply the LFO to the original oscillator, it can make the frequency of the sound it generates wobble about (a vibrato effect) or wobble its volume (tremelo).\n\n#### Analogy: human voice\nWhen a human sings, the vocal folds act as an oscillator, while the mouth and throat act as a filter.\n- consider that singing \"aaah\" has most of the original harmonics still present, but as we switch from \"aaah\" to \"oooh\", a lot of these harmonics are removed. In both cases, the sound generated by the vocal folds is more or less that same. It is the mouth (ie. the filter) that is responsible for altering the sound.\n    - note: by going back and forth between \"oooh\" and \"aaah\", the human voice is able to create a *spectral glide* (ie. a *sweeping filter*), similar to a wah-wah\n\n### Envelope\n- see [[music.acoustics.soundwave.envelope]]\n\nAn envelope shapes the sound in a certain way, depending on the type of envelope it is. \n- ex. If it is an amplitude envelope, then it shapes how the sound's amplitude changes over time. If it is \n\nIn the case of an amplitude envelope, the envelope tells the amplitude how to behave from the moment the key is pressed, to the moment it is released (and after; ie. `release`)\n\nIn the case of a filter envelope, the envelope determines the frequency content of the sound by using the cutoff and resonance controls.\n\n#### Filter Envelope Analogy: Human voice\nconsider the human voice going from \"oooh\" to \"aaah\". \n- A fast attack here would mean changing from \"oooh\" to \"aaah\" quickly.\n- Decay would determine how long we stay at the absolute \"aaah\" position. A short (quick) amount of decay would mean we arrive at the sustain level shortly after hitting the absolute \"aaah\" position.\n    - ex. think of the Tom Sawyer intro how it moves from that open mouth position to that closed mouth position.\n- Sustain would determine how much we close our mouth from the absolute \"aaah\" position. A lot of sustain would mean we barely close our mouth, while little sustain would mean we return very close to the \"oooh\" position.\n- Release would determine how quickly we return to the initial \"oooh\" position.\n\nyou might have an envelope for pitch, one for amplitude\n\n### Oscillator\nIn a synth, the oscillator produces the source of our sound (square wave, sawtooth wave, etc.)\n- different wave shapes produce different timbres\n\nAn oscillator is something that \"vibrates\", or repeats the same pattern. \n- ex. The pendulum of a clock, albeit a very slow oscillator. \n- ex. A piano string \"oscillates\" when struck by a hammer.\n- Electric oscillators might be made using transistors. They turn electricity into electrical patterns, or signals, that repeat over and over. When different keys are pressed, different notes are heard. This is done by making the signal from the oscillator repeat at different rates.\n- To get any sound, first we need a source. The most common source is a VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator)\n\nAn Oscillator makes a periodic signal, which can be listened to as a note or used to apply parameters to other synths, filters, etc. as a periodic signal\n\nanal: imagine an oscillator as a speaker on a carousel, while you are standing on the side\n- https://learningsynths.ableton.com/en/lfos/change-that-repeats\n\n#### Doubling\nOften, we want to combine 2 different oscillators into one. We can do this with a mix knob to bring the sounds together\n- this second oscillator might produce a unison sound, an octave, a harmonic interval etc.\n- most often we want to push the mix knob toward the lower pitched oscillator \n    - ex. if osc2 is at an octave higher than osc1, then we might put the mix knob at 70% osc1 and 30% osc2 in order to make a more cohesive sound. Otherwise, we find that the higher pitched oscillator dominates a little too much.\n\n### LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator)\nYou can think of LFOs as robots that make a repeating change to some aspect of the sound.\n- [visualization](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/en/lfos/modulating-pitch-with-oscillators)\n\nAn LFO is an oscillator that oscillates at 20Hz or less. It's particularly useful because it makes a fun modulation on stuff (wobwob) among other things It sounds cool, and might not have a high enough frequency to be heard by the human ear.\n\n- ex. an LFO might control how loud and soft the signal is, or control the pitch of the signal\n- ex. An LFO might even control the actions of the filters.\n\nnote: Don't confuse low frequency with meaning low pitch. While low pitches are indeed created by vibrating at low frequencies (the open E of the bass is about 41Hz), an LFO is not creating any sort of pitch for you to hear. It's using this low frequency in a different way.\n\n#### Params\n##### Speed\nControls the rate (frequency) at which the LFO loops\n\n##### Amount\nControls how flat/bumpy the LFO wave is\n\n##### Pulse width\nAllows us to change the shape of the waveform.\n- in its default state, it is simply a `square wave`\n\nThe pulse wave has a sort of artificial videogame-like quality to it.\n\nPulse width goes from thin (leftmost) -> medium -> square (rightmost)\n\nAt high pitches and with a thin pulse knob, a pulse wave sounds similar to a saw wave\n\nThe pulse width knob doesn't affect any other type of wave; only pulse waves\n- Pulse width may be named \"symmetry\", in which case it will also affect other waveforms\n\nhttps://learningsynths.ableton.com/en/oscillators/pulse-width\n\n### Filters\nA filter behaves a bit like a wall or door. It lets some parts of the sound through and makes other parts quieter.\n- anal: think of how music sounds while you are standing outside the room. It sounds muffled, since the walls are *filtering* out some frequencies. Now, when you open the door to the room, the music becomes less muffled, since those previously filtered frequencies can now be heard.\n\nA synth's filter is like a fingerprint— they all seem similar at first, but there are subtle differences that play a big part in determining the synth's character.\n\nLow pass filter is by far the most common type of filter\n\n#### Cutoff frequency\nControls the brightness of the sound (ie. the frequency at which sounds will be allowed to pass)\n- therefore, if we were going for a sound more reminiscent of a bass guitar, we'd turn this knob down quite a bit\n\nControlled with the `cutoff` knob\n- note: turning this knob down also reduces the volume of the patch, so we'll have to compensate by increasing the master volume of the synth.\n\nLower cutoff values make it more difficult to hear the characteristic differences between different waveforms.\n\n##### Resonance\nIncreases the amplitude around the cutoff frequency\n- https://learningsynths.ableton.com/en/filters/filter-resonance\n\n## Achieving different synth types\nThese are general guideline tips that should be thought of as starting points more than anything else.\n\n### Pads\nCharacterized by slow amp attack and release times.\n\nThey also normally have a low cutoff, creating a dark and round sound that allows the pad to blend more into the background\n### Lead\nCharacterized by high cutoff value\n\nVery quick amp attack\n\n### Bass\nCharacterized by a low cutoff value.\n\nThe square wave has a natural low end, which can be utilized to great effect when making a bass patch\n\nVery quick amp attack\n\n* * *\n\nA waveform is the raw sound that a synth generates\n- the waveform is generated by the oscillator\n\n## UE Resources\n- [this tool is good for learning how to create sounds that are in your head](https://www.syntorial.com/)\n    - $163CAD\n- https://learningsynths.ableton.com/\n- https://synthesizeracademy.com/\n\n## E Resources\n- https://www.explainthatstuff.com/synthesizers.html","n":0.025}}},{"i":156,"$":{"0":{"v":"Piano","n":1}}},{"i":157,"$":{"0":{"v":"Teaching","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nStart with B\n- https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php/topic,2701.msg23134.html#msg23134\n- https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=9062.0\n\nhttps://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=163.0\n\n## Kids\n### Posture\n- showed them how to put their hands on the keyboard, not slumping and keeping a 'bubble' under our hands.\n- straight back\n\n### Notes\n- talked about how notes go up / down.

We take these and we convert it into data so that it can be read by a computer.\n\nThe process by which a sound wave is converted into data is carried out by taking a series of snapshot measurements, or samples.\n- each snapshot is taken at an even interval of time, and snapshots are taken 1000's of times per second. We measure the amplitude of each interval of time, and output the samples that represent the original sound wave.\n\nBecause so many snapshots are taken, we are able to realistically reconstruct the analog wave.\n- The principles of [[math.calculus]] apply here, in that that we can get infinitely close, but not 100% of the way there.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-12-16-19-58-49.png)\n\n### Sample Rate\nThe *Sample Rate* measures the interval of time at which these samples are taken.\n- measured in kilohertz\n\nThe most common audio sample rate you’ll see is 44.1 kHz, or 44,100 samples per second.

Turn down the treble and you are cutting a portion of the eq above a certain threshold. \n\n### Gain\nGain can be thought of as the input volume to the preamp stage, although it's more of a tone control than a volume control. Your gain setting determines how hard you're driving the preamp section of your amp. Setting the gain control sets the level of distortion in your tone, regardless of how loud the final volume is set.\n- gain adjustments can produce changes in overall volume, which might account for some of the confusion between the terms\n\nThink of gain as sensitivity. Guitar pickups, microphones, all things in audio. Gain has the connotation of both tone and volume.\n- Gain adjusts the sensitivity of an audio transducer. As you go up in gain you go up in the amount of electricity flowing through the transducers and subsequent transformers.\n\n### Volume\nvolume on a tube amp is more than just making it louder, it actually increases how much drive the sound has as well.\n\nVolume and gain are similar, with the difference being at what stage the overall gain of the amp is being set. Volume is intended to set a secondary preamp gain stage.\n\n### MasterVolume\nMaster volume lives in the second stage of your amp, the power amp section. It provides the muscle.

What if you added a distortion plugin onto the master track? Every audio file would gain that distortion. What if we wanted to only apply distortion to the 3 electric guitars? We could output the 3 guitar tracks to a bus track, then apply the distortion plugin on that bus track. Then that bus track would output it's combined audio to the master track, mixing it with the rest of the tracks and buses. \n- This is useful for things like distortion/EQ/compression\n- In actuality, the bus is simply the connection between origin and destination. You'd add effects to the channel that you assigned the bus to, rather than to the bus itself.\n- buses are simply the connections between origins and destinations in a mixer\n- Imagine you have a string section, then you set the levels so they sound good between them, and now you mix them as a chunk.\n- In Reaper, a folder === bus\n\n### Send\n- Imagine we wanted to separate out the distorted part of the sound from the original sound?\n- ex. We record a snare drum and add reverb to it. What if we wanted to mix the original snare sound and the reverb differently? If we sent the snare to a bus and mixed the bus, we would have effectively glued those two parts of the sound together, rendering us unable to mix them separately.\n- A Send Track is similar to a bus track, with the difference being: the original snare sound is sent directly to the master, thereby bypassing the bus (and the effects it applies).\n    - In reality, the original snare sound is sent along with the reverb to the send. In essence there are 2 copies of the snare.\n    - A send is a split in the sound signal, so that it gets sent to 2 different places.\n\n#### Types:\n- each send is defined as one of 3 types:\n    - Post-fader (post-pan)\n        - default\n    - Pre-fader (post-FX)\n    - Pre-FX\n- Different send types send the audio at different stages in the signal flow.\n    - ex. the volume of a send that is Post-Fader (Post-Pan) will be affected by\nchanges made to the source track's volume fader. A `send` that is Pre-Fader (Post FX) will not. An audio `send` that is Pre-FX will be affected by the source track’s volume fader but not by any FX in the source track's FX chain\n\n### FX Track\n- an FX track outputs directly to the master, but it will take in inputs\n- For instance, say we have a delay and reverb combination that we want to put into an FX track. Anything that routes to this FX track will now pick up that delay and reverb before going on to the master.\n\n### VCA (Voltage control amplifier)\n- a VCA track will have a volume fader, which is used as a controller for the volume levels on other tracks.\n- ex. We assign guitar 1, 2, 3 to VCA1. So now when we reduce volume of VCA1, guitar 1, 2, 3 are also reduced in volume.\n- VCA does not actually route the audio, as a bus does.\n\n#### Usage\n1. View > Grouping matrix\n2. Select `show group details`\n3. set your VCA track (named `VCA1` here) as MASTER (M)\n4. set your slave tracks (S), causing their volume to be adjusted any time `VCA1` is adjusted.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-03-27-19-35-55.png)\n\n## Routing (I/O)\n- Sound files are read from the hard drive into Reaper, then will run through the tracks, and then be routed to the master.\n- On each track's route button, there is a master send checkbox, meaning if selected, that track gets routed to the master (which is the default behaviour)\n    - The master track itself will route to the hardware (audio interface)\n![](/assets/images/2021-03-27-19-36-06.png)\n\n## Mix Automation\n- The most popular use of automation in mixing is to adjust the volume of a track. For example, it allows you to bring an instrument to the forefront for a moment and fade it back out when the lead vocal comes back in\n    - Think Band on the Run, during the 3rd part when acoustic is front and center at first, but lowers in volume as the other instruments enter. \n- Examples:\n    - Automate an effect bypass on and off in certain sections of your song. This could be super useful if you want to create a delay or a long reverb tail only on a couple specific words to help emphasize them.\n    - Automate individual plugin parameters. This can be particularly handy when creating EQ filter sweeps, or when you want to alter the delay feedback amount in a section of your song.\n    - Automate a VCA or a bus to control the level of a group of instruments at once.\n    - Automate the master fader to create a fade out for the end of your song. \n- Use automation any time you want to adjust a parameter on any track or in any plug-in in your song.\n\n### Automation modes\n- Automation modes determine how automation is treated on a particular track.\n- Automation can either be read or written\nTypes:\n- Read - When we are playing the track, the DAW plays back all the automation on\n    the track. This is the most basic, and considered to be default.\n    - if we've set up automation to automatically adjust the volume at a certain\n        part of the song, the volume fader will move automatically.\n    - if we move any knobs, it will not write anything to the track. It will\n        merely be temporary.\n- Touch - When we are playing the track, the DAW plays back all the automation on\n    the track. The difference is, that if we move the knob while it's playing\n    back, we will adjust the automation on the fly.\n    - When we release the knob, the changes stop.\n    - This mode is useful if you only want to touch up (thus the name Touch) certain portions of your automation without affecting the rest.\n- Latch - like `Touch`, but when we release the knob, it will stay where it is.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-03-27-19-36-23.png)\n\n# Comping\n- def - taking multiple tracks of the same part of a song, and slicing in the\n    best parts of each.\n\n## Slice and Dice\n- When we have recorded the same thing multiple times, we have our lanes as a result. Our strategy is to split each take into phases, which roughly correspond to distinct sound waves.\n- Doing this, we can choose the best pieces, not only in raw performance, but also in the context of the other best guitar parts.\n    - first we choose the best 1st phrase, then the best 2nd phrase (while still playing back the 1st), then the best 3rd phrase (while still playing back the 1st and 2nd), and so on.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-03-27-19-36-35.png)\n\n- Each combination of these phrases is called a comp.\n\n## Comping tips\n- It's easier to comp a part that has been worked on in sections, because the singer's vocal tone will be more consistent between the takes\n\n# Features\n- Solo in Front - same as solo, except it just lowers the volume of everything else, instead of muting it\n    - found in `actions`\n\n# Tips\n- apply soft compression to glue everything together\n\n# Gain vs Volume\n- volume is the master level of output that a track will give out. It is the raw sound that comes out. In other words, it is after processing.\n    -  It’s the volume level being sent into your plugins, preamps, and amplifiers.\n- gain is the volume level of a signal before processing.\n    - How loud something is AFTER processing doesn’t change the tone of the sound. But how loud something is BEFORE processing definitely will.\n- changing the volume knob will change perceived loudness, and that's it. changing the gain will cause a literal difference in the sound.\n\n# Resources\n- [free kontakt libraries](https://www.flstudiomusic.com/2017/03/38-best-free-kontakt-libraries.html)\n\n# UE Resources\n- [Blog posts for understanding mixing concepts](https://www.izotope.com/en/learn.html)\n- https://heroic.academy/essential-guide-becoming-music-mixing-professional-part-2-signal-flow-plugins/\n- [How to comp](https://www.soundonsound.com/techniques/vocal-comping)\n\n\n# Questions \n- what is a channel?\n    - a channel is an audio signal, while a track is the place where that signal can be read/written.\n    - channels appear on the mixer, while tracks appear on the \"canvas\"\n    - channel represents the instantaneous path for a signal\n    - The track is like the read/write part of the program, while the channel is the route that the signal takes, while it is on its way to being written into the track.\n- When you mix a track, what is the high level?

The RMS size is how much it time it references to create the average. On percussive content this will make a big difference to how it reacts to the signal.\n- ie. RMS size is the window of time over which the signal/input level is root mean squared\n\nRMS (root mean square) compression means that the compressor will react according to the “average loudness” of the input or sidechain signal. As the “average” of the compressor control exceeds the threshold, the compressor will kick in.\n\nTurning up this control basically means the effect responds more to the average level than to the peaks.\n- A low RMS will be a lot \"grabbier\", quickly reacting to sudden changes in level, while a high RMS will be more \"smoothing\", making subtler changes over a long period of time.\n\nLike knee size, RMS size smooths the way the compressor reacts to the signal.\n- anal: Think of this like blurring a picture. In photo editing software, we can reduce the sample size of an image, making it blurrier. RMS size is analogous to this.\n\nthe longer you set the RMS window, the lower the level that hits the detector and shows on the meter, and the lower the threshold needed to get the same amount of gain reduction.\n\n### Low Pass / High Pass\nThese settings allow us to set filters, so that only that part of the signal that falls within the specified frequency range will be compressed.\n\nOften, these can be simply left alone, and you can do pre/post EQ\n\n## Techniques\n### Transparent volume leveling\nexample use-case: vocals\n\nThis technique is to be used near the final stages of a mix. That is, the dynamics of the mix should have already been tamed by the time this technique is applied.\n\nPut a compressor right on the Master track, to get a bit more \"loudness\" without losing so much transient information.\n\nThe trick is to set the RMS window pretty big, but then set the pre-comp to somewhere around half the RMS window. \n- This way, the compressor is reacting to the average level around the current sample - both past and future - so that if one bear is significantly louder than the next, it sort of gently dips the volume leading into the louder hit, and then comes back up afterwards in a pretty natural way\n- When pre-comp is exactly half of RMS, then it is applying maximum gain reduction exactly when it is loudest, it heads down a little early, and comes back a little late, and it lets anything fast that happens kind of just sail on through. If pre-comp is a little less than half, then it's a little more like a traditional attack/release, in that it reaches maximum crush a little late. Going the other way is like having a very timid soundguy anticipating your moves and turning down the fader when it looks like your going to get loud.\n\nAttack and release are basically built into the process, so set those parameters to 0, and use a very low ratio - 1.1 or 1.2\n- Basically, the relationship of the pre-comp to the RMS time determines your attack/release times\n\nfor even greater transparency, set the threshold so that it just barely starts squishing on some of the louder parts, and then crank the knee where up so that it's almost always doing just a tiny bit, but it's almost always in the knee, and almost never hits the full ratio.","n":0.041}}},{"i":168,"$":{"0":{"v":"Routing","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Pre FX - Signal Is sent to the desired bus before being processed by any inserted FX\n- Post FX - signal is sent to the bus after the FX but before the pan control\n- Post fader - ","n":0.162}}},{"i":169,"$":{"0":{"v":"Reference Tracks","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\nCritical when using reference tracks is to level match\n- typically, plugins will do this for us (Magic A/B etc.)\n\n### Rationale for this Dendron note\nAs part of the reference track notes we should have sections that kind of demonstrate my favourite artists and influences.

Corrective action\n2. Spatial mixing\n3. Artistic mixing\n4. Final touches\n\n### Corrective Action\nIdeally we should listen to each track individually and look out for places that need corrective action.\n\nThe methodical approach would be:\n- You hear a problem\n  - ex. guitar is too muddy, vocalist's breath sounds are too loud etc.\n- You brainstorm ways to fix that problem\n- You try to fix the problem\n- You determine whether or not you fixed the problem\n- ...and repeat\n\nExamples of things that require corrective action, and thus should be fixed at this stage:\n- guitar track sounds too boomy\n- individual drum sounds (ex. of a MIDI drumkit) don't have the right timbre\n- small glitches that need removing\n- minimizing impact of bleed\n- removing unwanted background noise\n- conspicuous vocal plosives (firm B and P sounds), esses and gasping\n\n### Spatial mixing (stereo imaging)\nThis is where we work out our desired sound stage, by positioning each instrument as we want it to be in our final mix.\n\nStereo Imaging is the manipulation of a signal within a 180-degree stereo field, for the purpose of creating a perception of locality within that field.  \n- Panning gives perception of sound coming from left to right\n  - x axis\n- Volume gives perception of volume closer or further away\n  - z axis\n- Frequency of sound gives perception of height (which can be manipulated with eq)\n  - y axis\n\nGiving a mix space means you can hear each and every instrument clearly and distinctly, yet with everything also blended in nicely with the overall production.\n- Each sound should have its own space.\n\nThere are 4 dimensions to space:\n- width (between the speakers)\n- height (frequency)\n- depth (volume)\n- time\n\nnote: (ReaMix p.64) find a table of different ways to position each sound within a location on this soundscape (e.g. panning and EQ, but also reverb, delay, compression etc.)\n\n\n### Artistic mixing\nThis is where we set about building our song and creating its structure.\n- ex. highlight a particular instrument here, add some clever effects at certain passages etc.\n\n* * *\n\n## High-level Philosophy\n### Make contrasting moves\nWhen visualizing a change, consider making contrasting moves (ie. splitting that change across 2 different areas).\n- ex. say you want to get more bite out of your guitars, so your inclination is to make a 2dB boost at 2.8kHz. Instead of doing this, make a 1dB boost at the 1.2kHz, but on some other track/bus, make a 1dB cut at 400-500hZ (*complementary EQ*)\n- ex. if mix is not dense enough, your inclination might be to add 2dB of gain reduction on the compressor. Instead of doing that, add 1dB of gain reduction on the compressor, but then add a bit of saturation before and/or after the compressor.\n- ex. if your vocal doesn't feel present enough, you might want bump it up by 2dB at 1.8kHz. Instead of doing that, try bumping it up by 1dB, and take your vocal FX (e.g. delay, reverb) and turn it all up. Then, if the vocal is too low, pull the whole volume fader down (vocal dry track and FX), while at the same time nudging up that 1.8kHz.\n\n### Use many instances of plugins, with small impact per plugin\n\n\n* * *\n\n### Making dynamics in a mix\nThere are 4 tools that can be used to create dynamics in a mix:\n1.

Then get the dynamics you want. Then do tone shaping without affecting dynamics.\n\n## Things to try\n- distortion - make sounds stand out more in a mix by applying some level of distortion. If you don't add too much, distortion can be imperceptible within the whole mix, but makes the instrument that it's on stand out more\n  - see [[saturation|music.engineering.mixing.saturation]]\n  - anal: distortion in this case is like salt that brings out the distinctive flavors of an umami food.\n\n* * *\n\n- [What is an envelope?](https://youtu.be/c3udLCvoCC0?t=67)\n\n## UE Resources\n- [Beginners guide to EQ (hosted by Dan Worrall, who comes recommended)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fDg_pgit5c)\n- [Mix tutorial from start to finish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oyj8uyXo74)\n- [Mixing secrets for the small studio](https://www.cambridge-mt.com/ms/mtk/)\n- [The Mixing Engineer's Handbook](https://www.amazon.ca/Mixing-Engineers-Handbook-5th/dp/1946837121)\n- Mixing with Mike \n\n### Ear training\n- Soundgym.co\n- Audio university\n- Audiodrillz.app\n\n## Resources\n- [Mixing engineers for hire](https://soundbetter.com/s/mixing-engineers)","n":0.035}}},{"i":175,"$":{"0":{"v":"Volume","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nRemember that apparent volume is what matters, not dB. The shape of the soundwave also affects how loudly we perceive something\n- even at the same dB level, a chainsaw will sound much louder than a flute because of the shape of the soundwave.\n\nOnce an instrument playing a certain pattern is heard, it is safe to blend back into the mix, where even if it is barely audible, the listener will be able to clearly discern what is being played, due to the fact they've already heard it.\n- ex. a common pattern for a song has a guitar playing solo, only to be joined by other instruments progressively. Once these other instruments get added, it's fine to lower the volume on the guitar, since its distinctive pattern has already been heard and the listener can fill in the blanks on their own.\n\nIt is not uncommon for the engineer to vary the volume faders throughout the song as dynamics change (ex. instruments are added, entering a new section of the song etc.)\n- [[compressors|music.engineering.mixing.compressor]] can only do so much before they start sounding unnatural.\n\nThe volume fader is the volume of the track after the FX pipeline has been applied to it. \n- It is the volume level that will be piped into the it's `send` (ie. the next place in the pipeline)\n\n### Volume as a measure of depth control\nConceptually, in a 3D space, a higher volume would indicate that the sound is closer to us. But if we want a sound to be perceived as closer to the listener, the solution is not always as simple as increasing the volume. There are 2 things to understand with this:\n1. Different frequencies decay through space at different rates, meaning that as you move closer to or further from a sound, the relative levels of different frequencies will change.\n  - higher frequencies decay at a faster rate, which is why when a distant sound first approaches you, you may find that you hear only the bass frequencies at first, followed by the rest of the sound (or vice versa, depending on the physical environment)\n2. The clarity of a sound deteriorates with distance. The further away a sound is, the more muffled it appears.\n\nFor these reasons, we need some other tools (together along with volume) to create the illusion of depth, such as [[compression|music.engineering.mixing.compressor]]\n\n### Relative volume\nWhen doing your initial volume setting of each track, it's easier to scope small and gently expand outward\n- ex. volume-match your cellos first, then your string section, then your brass section, then your string section AND brass section, and so on.\n\n## Volume balancing\nVolume balancing should be the first step of any mix.\n\nCan use a strategy of *height order*, where we loop the loudest part of the sound (with likely the most instruments playing simultaneously)\n1. Turn everything all the way down\n2. Choose which instrument is the most important (e.g. kick, snare, vocal etc), and bring it up to -5dB\n3. Next, bring up the next most important element and balance it with that first most important instrument\n4. Continue this process until everything is balanced around that single most important instrument\n\n## Framework: Levels of volume\nA useful framework for thinking about relative (apparent) volumes is to place each instrument in one of 6 levels\n\n- positioning of snare is quite varied, and depending on the genre, can appear from level 4 to level 2\n  - [ref](https://youtu.be/TEjOdqZFvhY?t=6540)\n- vocals can also appear at various levels depending on genre and how strong the vocalist is\n  - [ref](https://youtu.be/TEjOdqZFvhY?t=6385)\n- kick drum may appear at various levels as well.\n  - ex. Kick drum in Jimi Hendrix' music is at around level 4 and can barely be heard\n  - ex. Heavy metal commonly places kick drum around level 2\n  - [ref](https://youtu.be/TEjOdqZFvhY?t=6668)\n- bass guitar was traditionally quite low at level 3/4, but has progressively gotten louder and is commonly found at level 2/3\n  - commonly, the fewer instruments in the mix, the louder the bass, since it does a good job of filling out the space between the speakers\n- consider that a song can have varying ranges of volume levels, that is often influenced by genre\n  - ex. some music has a range than spans only volume levels 2-4, while others might cover all\n    - Pink Floyd's music typically has quite a wide range of volume levels\n\n### Level 1\nAn unusually loud volume. Placing instruments at this level is the exception rather than the rule. If not done carefully it can sound like an error\n- ex. the alarm clocks at the start of Time by Pink Floyd\n\n### Level 2\nLead instruments and vocals (when vocals/lyrics are meant to be the main focal point of the song)\n- ex. Bob Dylan's music normally has vocals at this level\n- ex. \"kick\" drum in hip hop, kick drum and toms in heavy metal\n\n### Level 3\nPrimary rhythm parts\n- ex. guitar, keyboard, vocals (when not meant to be the dominant focal point)\n- ex. kick drums (heavy metal), snare (dance music), toms, cymbals, hi-hat (occasionally)\n\n### Level 4\nRhythm beds and chordal pads\n- ex. background piano, background strings, keys, guitar\n- ex. drums (jazz)\n- ex. hi-hat\n\nWhen reverb is noticeable as a sound on its own, it is usually at this level\n\n### Level 5\n- ex. Kick drum (jazz, big bang music)\n- ex. Background vocals\n\nlots of FX and reverb live at this level so you can only hear them if listening closely\n\n### Level 6\nSoft and hard to detect sounds\n- ex. whisper sounds found in Pink Floyd music\n\n* * *\n\n### Gain Staging\nThe source signal of an audio track goes through a pipeline before it ultimately arrives at the master bus.\n- ex. this pipeline might be:\n  1. the guitar signal is WAV audio track\n  2. the track is in an `Acoustic Guitar` bus (ie. folder in Reaper)\n  3. the `Acoustic Guitar Bus` gets routed into the `Acoustic Verb` send, which gets routed to the `Guitars Bus`\n  4. and so on\n\nSome steps of the pipeline will naturally involve some level of volume increase\n- ex. compression, reverb and EQ are all stages that add volume to the mix\n\nBecause one of the first steps of mixing is to set the fader levels, we don't want our compressor/EQ adding perceptible volume to the track. Therefore, when we are happy with the parameters of our FX, we need to A/B test it by bypassing it on and off. Adjust the volume level of the `B` to match the `A`.\n- ex. Imagine we are A/B testing our compressor on the guitar. We toggle the FX on, and adjust up/down the post-FX gain (?) so that it matches the perceived volume level when the FX is off\n \n* * *\n\n## Strategy for volume level setting\nA good way of achieving good balance of volume is to put your volume very low and walk into the next room. Get to a point where you can barely hear the sound. The element that pops out the most is too loud and should be brought down \n\n* * *\n\nThe biggest game changer for me was when I realized how important the volume sliders on each track are and developing a good strategy for how to use them. My goal when mixing is to let everything have its turn. I do this by imagining you only get to hear one thing at a time. If a drum is struck, its attack should be louder than anything else and it is the only thing that needs to be heard. But luckily there’s lots of space between drums because they are percussion instruments. As soon as the transient attack decays from its peak I don’t need to hear it anymore, and now there’s all this wonderful open space inbetween each drum hit where I no longer need to hear the drum and am free to hear something else: but again, I only get to pick one thing to hear at a time in these spaces between the drums. Using this idea I try to set my levels loudest on the tracks that have the highest transients and lowest for the things that have the slowest decays.\n\nSo for example let’s say I have the following tracks: a drone synth pad, some guitars, bass, vocals, and drums. First thing to do is pull down all your faders so everything is silent. Then I’ll start by bringing up the synth pads first because they are long passages of relatively equal volume that don’t change a whole lot. They are the least dynamic of all the tracks. I bring them up to a decent level but not too high because everything else needs to go on top of them. Maybe about halfway. Next I’ll pull up the bass guitar because it has more dynamic attack than the pads but still lots of sustain (second-least dynamic of my tracks, so I address it second). My goal here is to bring the volume of the bass up so that when I watch the meters, the attack of the bass string being struck pops up above the volume of the synth pads. So long as that attack on the bass is louder than the pads, then I know I’ll hear the bass in my mix, even if the sustain drops below the pads afterward.\n\nIn essence what we’ve got now is kind of like a rolling fog of synth pads with mountain peaks of bass transients popping up through that fog. I’ve made space for both now. When the bass is plucked I hear it (and not the synth pad) but when it decays below that fog I hear the synth (inbetween the peaks of bass note attack). By doing this I’ve made dynamic space for both in the temporal plane. It’s like eq for time instead of frequency! Everybody knows you should  use eq to carve space in the frequency domain. But it took me forever to realize I need to use volume dynamics to carve space out of time! How did I not see that sooner???\n\nSo next I’ll do the same for guitars. They’re generally similar in volume to the bass, but with a bit more transient attack. I also use wide panning on the guitars so their peaks can be heard above the fog in the L/R space whereas the bass peaks pop up down the centre. But yeah, I want their peaks just above the bass, but doesn’t need to be by much for the reasons I just mentioned.\n\nNext is the vocals. Consonants and plosives are even more dynamic than guitars, bass or pads. So my goal is to get the vocal transients to pop up above the cloud cover of everything else so far. I raise the fader on my vocals until the volume peaks crest the summed volume of everything else set so far. It can be handy to temporarily group or route your synth, bass and guitars to one bus so that you can watch their summed volume meter next to the vocal track meter to ensure the vocal peaks crest everything else.\n\nAnd lastly, drums are the most dynamic with super fast attack and decay. So I set them loudest so they peak above everything else.\n\nIf I’ve successfully done my job here, when a drum is hit I hear the drum and then it quickly gets out of the way with a fast decay to make space. And in that space between drum hits, a vocal consonant pops up and is heard above all else and then gets out of the way for other things to be heard. And in the spaces between drum hits and vocal consonants, the pluck of a guitar string rises above everything else and then gets out of the way. And now in the space between drum hits, consonants and plucked guitars, a bass note rises above and then drops away… to reveal the synth pad that is droning along in all the remaining spaces between and under everything else.\n\nThe idea here is that you don’t actually get to hear everything at the same time. If everything was hard compressed and set to equal volumes you’d just hear a long muddy wash of all tracks playing at once. Unless that’s what you’re specifically going for that’s generally not what you want. It’s boring to listen to because it isn’t changing. But if your brain hears a drum and then a word and then a guitar chord and then a bass note and then a synth pad… one at a time in quick succession… it gets excited!!!! There’s a lot of different things happening quickly over time for it to process… instead of everything happening at once all the time without any change in focus.\n\nNow since music generally has a rhythmic component you may wonder how this can work when all tracks play on the same beat? Well, it still works because we ordered it so that the quickest decay is loudest. In this case you hear the drum on the beat first because it’s loudest. But it dies away so quickly (fast decay) that it drops out to reveal the consonant of the vocal milliseconds later. It should decay fast enough that you don’t miss hearing most of the consonant! But then the consonant drops off too and you hear that guitar chord coming through now… and you may only be getting that last bit of the guitar strum attack but it’s enough. And as that last bit of the guitar attack decays it reveals the bass underneath. And maybe you missed hearing most or even all of the actual bass attack underneath everything else but that warm early sustain now shines through and is like syrup after the percussive attack of everything else, and as it dies away, it reveals below everything else our ever-present synth pad holding it all together. At this point you for sure missed hearing the attack of the synth but it doesn’t matter because it barely has any attack to speak of anyway. So yeah, that’s why it’s important to set your levels so the meters peak loudest on the fastest, most dynamic tracks. Because even if every track plays each note at the exact same time this strategy allows each layer to peel away and reveal the track underneath.\n\nOnce I started thinking about things this way I realized I could get 80% of the way there with just the faders and nothing else. Which is crazy because I saw them as second-class citizens to the jobs of eqs and compressors and reverbs and panning for so long. But they are SO critical despite their bare simplicity!!! I’m self-trained so maybe I’m an idiot for not having understood this sooner and everyone else already knew all this. But man, the simplest of things had the greatest effect.\n\nFurthermore, once you understand the “only one thing at a time” paradigm you realize the other tools are just more granular versions for achieving the same thing. For example: are all your tracks too dynamic? If they’re all super percussive then there’s not enough time to reveal those layers beneath. So what do you do? Well, that’s the compressor’s time to shine! Throw lots of compression on your synth, slightly less compression on your bass, a little less on your guitars, almost none on your vocals, and none at all on your drums, and now suddenly you’ve got a good range of low vs high dynamic tracks so that the layers can be peeled back to reveal everything beneath just like we want. Obviously there are so many more applications for compressors than just this, but prior to my thought that you should only be “hearing just one thing at a time” I never would have thought to use them in this application. Reverb is a good way to reduce dynamics too, but it can offer a pleasing stereo spatial component too. So it’s kind of like a “blurry” compressor if you think about it. Again… perhaps an oversimplification but not something I would have considered prior to understanding this paradigm! And I realized side-chaining is sometimes so effective because it’s just brute-forcing the “one thing at a time” concept to the extreme!\n\nBut yeah, seriously. It’s ALL about volume and only having one loudest thing at a time. Once I got that, everything else just got better. And at the end of the day, I could still compress the hell out of the master to sound “loud enough”, but so long as I first gave everything it’s “time to shine” as the loudest part in the mix, then it still sounds relatively ok. Even if you have to brick wall the whole track because the client wants it “louder” and all the dynamics are lost (not great but sometimes that’s what they want), the clarity still remains intact in the temporal domain because you made sure only one primary thing needed to be heard at a time.\n\nAnyway, sorry that was so long. But just felt like if somebody had explained this to me at the outset I would have saved myself so many years of grief and confusion. So yeah, I hope at the very least that I can save somebody else from some of that misery.\n\nLastly- I should say that if it sounds good you’re doing it right. This is as much art as it is science. Use the advice that works for you and drop the stuff that doesn’t. Don’t use my advice here if it does nothing for what you’re trying to accomplish. My word is certainly not law, and neither is anyone else’s. There’s a million ways to make this work. Find the ways that work best for you!\n\n## Measures of Volume\nA decibel (dB) is just a ratio, there has to be a reference level for it to become a unit (of sorts). \n\n### dB SPL (Sound Pressure Level)\nWhen the average person talks about \"decibels\" they are usually (unknowingly) talking about dB SPL which has some arbitrary definition of the lower limit of human hearing as a reference (according to wikipedia it's about as loud as a mosquito flying 3m away)\n- ex. you can't exactly hear a gun shot and say 'that was 80dBs', because it relates to how far you are from the source and what reference you are using. If you were to move 50% closer, that 80 dB (SPL) would become 86 dB SPL, because now your perspective is different\n\n### db FS (Full Scale)\nWhen talking about audio in the digital realm, dBFS is used, but instead of the reference being the quietest possible limit, it's the loudest (imposed as a standard) and thus negative values are used to count back from the top. Any signal that passes above 0dB FS gets chopped off, which is known as digital clipping.\n\n### RMS (Root Mean Square)\nRMS represents the average (also called “integrated”) loudness of a signal. \n- It will typically take a measurement every 300ms, which means whatever peaks occur within that time frame get averaged out for the RMS reading. So RMS isn’t as precise as peak metering, but it actually gives us a better understanding of overall loudness based on the average strength of the signal.\n\nRMS is useful for whenever you want a reading closer to a person’s actual perception of loudness.\n\nRMS is usually the unit used for the master track.\n\nMathematically, we derive the RMS by taking the average value (ie. mean), squaring it, then taking the square root.\n- we do this process of squaring then taking square root so that the resultant value is always positive.\n\n### LUFS (Loudness Unit Full Scale)\nLUFS is a measurement of perceived loudness obtained by measuring the average level over time.\n\nTwo pieces of music that register identical LUFS readings should sound like they’re at the same level, regardless of whatever the peak or RMS readings say\n- therefore, LUFS offers a benefit to the mastering process when we want all tracks to have the same volume level.\n\nLUFS-M - Momentary Max\nLUFS-S - Short-term Max\nLUFS-I - Integrated\n\n### Loudness Range (LRA)\nThe lower the number, the less dynamics. \n- since classical music tends to have many loud parts and quiet parts, you might find LRA of 9+, whereas rock music, which is typically more stable is usually around 5-6.\n- Note that this is not about dynamic range, but rather, musical dynamics.\n\n","n":0.017}}},{"i":176,"$":{"0":{"v":"Vocals","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nVocals are normally panned center, and double-tracked if stereo.\n\n### Compression/EQ\nCompression is a great way to bring a vocal forward in a mix\n- it can also cause unappealing sonic artifacts. [[Parallel compression|music.engineering.mixing.compressor.techniques#parallel-compression]] can be used to remedy this issue.\n- [guide: adding parallel compression to vocals](https://sundownsessionsstudio.com/parallel-compression-vocals/)\n\nUse a high-pass filter if there are any rumbly low frequencies, and perhaps some lower-mids to make sure that the compressor isn’t getting overloaded — then apply compression to taste — and then with another EQ, perhaps boost around 10-15k to add air. Maybe then send all the vocals to an aux that is part of a multibuss setup and EQ or saturate at that stage, and then again when mastering.\n\n#### De-essing\nStrongly consider using a de-esser when using multiple vocal tracks, since the same consonant sounds done by multiple tracks can muddy things up considerably. Consider putting aggressive de-essing on the background vocals only, and only light de-essing on the lead vocal.\n- an alternative approach might be to remove those plosives entirely from all vocal tracks except the lead vocal track.\n\n#### Try\nMulti-stage compression:\n1. fast-ish attack, fast release, ~4:1 ratio\n2. slower attack, slower release, ~4:1 ratio (to even out the average level of the signal)\n\n### Delay\nTry creating a bold and dreamy delay AUX that is triggered every so often throughout the arrangement\n- ex. [Rush - Workin' them Angels](https://youtu.be/rTQIYpqVdzA?t=96), at the end of phrase around 1:36\n\n#### Lead\n- Stereo slapback delay is a great way to get a sense of space on lead vocals without pushing it back too far in the mix\n    - [A/B](https://youtu.be/dO1OOzfGmLQ?t=269)\n- use a dual delay (say with 1/4 or 1/8 note delay length), cutting a lot of low and high out of the delay so that the delay doesn't interfere too much with the original vocal, and instead provides a bed of sustain for the vocals to sit on.\n    - https://youtu.be/9ho9SyxrqHI?t=494\n\n#### Harmony\n- Add dreamy reverb + delay to harmony vocals for an airy quality\n\n#### With ducking\nTry applying delay only at the end of phrases. This can be accomplished by having a [[Gate|music.engineering.mixing.gate]] set to [[Ducking|music.engineering.mixing.gate#ducking,1]] mode, and routing the vocals through it via a Side-chain source (an option of the Gate plugin)\n\n### Reverb\nToo much reverb on vocals pushes it back too far in the mix.\n- try stereo slapback delay instead\n\nTry less density (diffusion) when it comes to reverb for vocals. It helps with clarity, as diffusion can make things sound mushy. We are trained to react to the human voice, so the intuition is to preserve the quality of a voice in the reverberation.\n\n### EQ\nWhen EQing vocals, your default should be to stick with a subtracting EQ approach\n\nIf vocals sounds a little dull, experiment with:\n\n| Male/female   | 40-60Hz | 200-400Hz | 1000-3000Hz | 5000-8000Hz | 10000-12000Hz |\n|---------------|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------------|\n| Female Vocals |         | +2dB      |             | +2dB        |               |\n| Male Vocals   |         | +3dB      |             |             |               |\n\n","n":0.046}}},{"i":177,"$":{"0":{"v":"Strings","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n### Panning\nFrom left to right\nViolin1 - Viola - Bass - Cello - Violin2","n":0.277}}},{"i":178,"$":{"0":{"v":"Saturation","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nSaturation is a form of distortion that can be applied to an audio signal to add warmth, harmonics, and character to the sound.\n\nSaturation can be applied to a track to add color and texture to the sound, especially for instruments such as guitars, drums, and vocals. \n\nSaturation can help to bring out the harmonics and overtones in a sound, making it sound fuller and more present in the mix.\n\nSaturation can also help to tame harsh or bright sounds, by rounding off the high-frequency transients and adding a sense of warmth to the overall sound. \n\nThere are 2 main types of saturation\n- even harmonic distortion\n- odd harmonic distortion\n\nAny given saturation plugin is neither one nor the other, but is rather a combination of the two, with an emphasis on one or the other depending on the plugin.\n- as you increase the drive knob of the saturation, there will be increased variation of odd and even harmonic distortion.

The rate at which these reflections decay will depend both upon the size of the room in which the sound occurs, and where the listener is positioned.\n\nSome reverb plugins use a combination of 2 different parameters — *room size* and *decay time* — to achieve this effect, while some use just one or the other.\n\n### Predelay\nthe period of time it takes for the sound to hit a wall and come back to your ear\n- therefore, big rooms have longer predelay times\n- imagine if you were in a concert hall listening to a violinist play their instrument. As she plays the instrument, the sound travels out in all directions. Some of the sound travels directly to your ears, while a short while later, more soundwaves will hit your ears, which will have been the waves that reflected off the wall first. The very short amount of time that passes between these two events is known as *predelay*\n- Increasing predelay creates the illusion of a larger space\n\nIf we have a long predelay, we will notice that we hear the dry sound, then a period of time will pass, followed by the wet reverb sound\n\n### Envelope\n- how the reverb changes its volume over time (e.g. gated reverb)\n\n### Diffusion\nThe higher your diffusion setting is, the more dense/close together the reflections will be. Generally, higher settings can make for a more natural-sounding reverb and lower settings for a more ‘airy’ effect.\n- Diffusion is closely tied to room density, and you may even see it called this instead. Less density / diffusion creates an emptier sound with more distinct reflections. More diffusion creates a “blurry” sound, giving the impression of a furnished or “dense” space as opposed to an empty room.\n\n### Damping\nAs the sound waves bounce around all over the place, their timbre will be affected by the type of material that they hit.\n- ex. reverberation off a hard surface like concrete will be clearer and more distinct, as the high-frequency sounds are reflected more, compared to the reverberation off of curtains. In the latter case, the higher frequencies will decay quicker, resulting in a warmer sound.\n\nDamping smooths out the high frequencies in the reflections to further shape the reverb tail. This is usually done with low-pass filters. A high damp setting means more high frequencies are cut.\n\nnote: in Fabfilter Pro-R, use Decay Rate EQ to achieve this damping effect.\n\n### Distance\nhow far away the source of the sound is from the supposed microphone in the room\n\n### Early reflections\nthese are the sounds that reach our ears directly after bouncing off a surface (e.g. wall, ceiling). It is notable to realize that after these sounds bounce off one surface, they will bounce off another, and another. Gradually over time, these reflections become less distinct and merge into each other.\n\n### High / Low Frequency filters or attenuation (ie. EQ)\nThese settings can be used to restrict the reverb to only the range of frequencies that we specify\n\nThink of this as putting an EQ *only* on the sounds that have been reflected off of the surfaces.","n":0.044}}},{"i":181,"$":{"0":{"v":"Piano","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nA solo piano is almost always panned center","n":0.354}}},{"i":182,"$":{"0":{"v":"Panning","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nUsually, the most problematic area of the sound field is the center, as this is normally the busiest place within a mix. It is advisable to keep the kick, snare, bass, and vocal in the center as they provide the music with a solid grounding and help aid the rhythm (although these rules can often be broken to great effect). For every other instrument, however, it is advisable to position them either side of the center.\n\nBe careful not to pan too aggressively, as the instruments still need to blend together to make an integrated mix.\n\nTo maintain balance within a mix, for every element panned one way, another element should be panned the other\n\nBass heavy instruments should generally live at or near the centre.\n\nIf you want to feature an instrument more in a mix, you can try going direct on one side and a heavily modulated version of it on the other side\n- Microshift is good for this (just make sure to verify what it sounds like in mono).\n\nIf we want to bring an instrument more into prominence, we can do so with panning, by moving an instrument that was previously panned over to one side to the center. Imagine the first verse of our song was driven by mandolin, so we kept it centered. Then in the second verse, the lead guitar (which was 50%L) takes more focus, so we move the mandolin slightly off center, and move the lead guitar to the center. Finally, in the 3rd verse we want to feature the banjo, so we move the lead guitar back to where it was at 50%L, and move the banjo to the center (which was 50%R)\n- To bring further emphasis to the instrument we are panning center, it's a reasonable idea to increase the volume of that section as well.\n\nIf everything is all stereo all the time, then you miss out on the opportunity to highlight things by using stereo. That is, purposefully make things sounds more \"mono\" during less exciting parts of the song, and widen it with stereo during exciting parts (e.g. chorus)\n- Consider using panning to make the chorus sound more \"stereo\" (ie. have more width) than the verses (e.g. pan OHs more toward centre during verse)\n\nIf one instrument is panned toward one side for verse1, try panning it on the opposite side for verse2\n\n### Double tracking\nWhen double tracking instruments with panning, if we pan them hard left/right, we make those tracks sound more prominent. If we instead want those tracks to support the main track, then we should consider panning them less hard (say ~50% left/right)\n\n### Pan law\nAs we pan a sound further away from centre, its perceived volume drops. \n- Therefore, panning does not just operate on the horizontal dimension of the soundscape, but also depth.\n\nThe pan law setting determines the rate at which the volume of a track appears to decrease as we pan further from the center.\n\n## Types of panning\n\n## Panning techniques\nAvoid hard panning parts that are very critical to a song, because in mono it won't sound that great.\n- note: this doesn't mean you can't do it, but you will drown out the instrument, and it will need to be brought back using some other kind of mixing technique.\n\n### Double Tracking\nIf you don't want to actually double track and instrument but want the benefits, you could pan the track hard left, send to a bus with ~20ms delay, then pan that hard right.\n\n### Bookend Panning\nWhat if we want to create a spatial relationship between 2 instruments, but there arises a problem of one of the instruments drowning out the other? The obvious solution is to pan them away from each other, but what if we want to (or need to) keep them relatively near each other on the left-right spectrum?\n- ex. if we have mandolin and banjo parts, the mandolin will naturally overwhelm the banjo, since the mandolin has higher frequencies.\n\nIf we had a guitar panned left, a banjo panned center (as it is meant to be the main rhythmic instrument) and a mandolin center-right, what we could do is add banjo sounds just to the right of the Mandolin, so that the mandolin is wrapped by the banjo on either side. This prevents the mandolin from overwhelming the banjo.\n\n### Microshifting\nMicroshifting is a technique to widen the stereo image of a sound\n\n1. Take one stereo track, pan it center and keep it there. \n2. Next, duplicate that track twice (so you now have three versions) and put a pitch shifting plugin on both copies. Pan one hard left and the other hard right.\n3. Now, use the pitch shifter to pitch one copy down a few cents (5-10 cents is common) and pitch the other copy up the same amount of cents.\n\n#### In Reaper\nSee p.71 of ReaMix\n\n## UE Resources\n- [Frequency-based panning](https://www.pro-tools-expert.com/production-expert-1/spectral-pan-frequency-based-panning)","n":0.035}}},{"i":183,"$":{"0":{"v":"Orchestra","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n## UE Resources\n- [Mixing orchestral instruments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3Abis3IiI4)","n":0.408}}},{"i":184,"$":{"0":{"v":"Guitar","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nDistorted electric guitar is not normally compressed, since they are basically already compressed\n- same with square-waved synths\n- note, this does not apply to using a multi-band compressor in order to tone shape, as this solved a different issue altogether\n- [source](https://youtu.be/7oOmX3JHwtE?t=114)\n\n### EQ\nMost of the problem frequencies in acoustic guitar are in mid-range (somewhere around 900-1000 hZ)\n\nHigh frequencies (~8k-10k hZ) are typically undesirable, so it's a good idea to use a high cut filter.\n\nOverdriven guitars benefit from slight boosts (~5-10dB) in the midrange (~1k hZ)\n\nTry cutting the *oomph* sound made by the pick hitting the strings on the downstroke, which typically occurs somewhere between 150-200hZ\n- this sound can be seen in the soundwave as the loudest point in the wave, occuring right at the start of the sound.\n\nThere's nothing really of value at around 50hZ and below, so cut it all out with a high-pass filter\n- you probably won't hear a difference, but this sound may manifest on woofers of different speaker systems.\n\nIf guitar sounds a little dull, experiment with:\n\n| instrument      | 40-60Hz | 200-400Hz | 1000-3000Hz | 5000-8000Hz | 10000-12000Hz |\n|-----------------|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------------|\n| Acoustic Guitar |         | -5dB      |             | +3dB        | +2dB          |\n| Electric Guitar |         |           | +3dB        |             |               |\n\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-08-14-15-31-20.png)\n\n### Compression\nAcoustic guitar can sometimes do without compression.

It’s an excellent way to create a sense of space and movement in a mix.\n\n### Multitap Delay\nThe idea with multitap delay is that instead of having a single delay that feeds back into itself, we have a chain of delays, with the final delay in that chain feeding back into the first delay.\n- see P.99 of ReaMix\n\nMultitap delay can be used to fill out the space around an instrument, making it sound more present, but with an added clarity that wouldn't be heard with a single delay.","n":0.038}}},{"i":189,"$":{"0":{"v":"Compressor","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n## What is it?\nA compressor is a [[volume|music.engineering.mixing.volume]] function. After a certain threshold of dB, the volume is decreased.\n- The result is a reduction in the dynamic range of an audio signal\n\nIf we visualize music in a 3D space, where volume is represented as distance from us, a compressor is like a wall that sits between us and the sound. If using a limiter (ie. a compressor with a max threshold), then the wall will not allow the sound to get past that threshold at all.\n- [ref](https://youtu.be/TEjOdqZFvhY?t=3138)\n\nThe original purpose of a compressor was to reduce dynamics. While they can, and that was their original intention, it isn’t the entire story. They’re actually relatively poor at this job compared to other tools. Think of compressors as tools that help you shape the Envelope of the source. Compressors can reduce or expand the dynamics of a source.\n\nPlaying with the attack is a good place to start for beginners because it’s the easiest to hear. Hearing the effect of the release is a little trickier but really great once you get the hang of it. Being able to create depth with just compression and EQ really elevates your mixes, without having to rely on reverb etc to do this for you exclusively.\n\nIf you set the threshold lower than the attack, it'll take a bit of time to get down to the new compressed level every time a sound starts, causing it to have a 'punch' or 'snap' like sound when the sound starts.\n- Sometimes you like that snap, sometimes you want that snap to push into the limiter/master chain to saturate it a bit. Or even just slap a saturator on the end so the level is still the same as before, but now it has a bit more saturation on the start of phrases.\n\n### Flavors of compressor\nThe stated goal of a compressor has always been to \"tighten the leash on a source\". While transparency was always the intent, historically, analog compressors always had their own sound to them. With the advent of the DAW, digital compressors are able to offer true transparency, though the artifact flavor imparted by the analog compressors have since been considered desirable.\n- the stock compressors in a DAW usually offer a transparent (flavorless) compressor\n\n## Why use it?\n3 main purposes\n- better signal/noise ratio (ie. less hiss)\n- stabilize the sound image (ie. more presence)\n- bring sound elements closer/further away from listener\n\n### Better signal \nif we have quiet parts and loud parts in a song, simply reducing the volume will take care of unintended distortion from the loud sounds, but it will make the quiet sounds too quiet, and lead to hiss. \n\n### Stabilize the sound image\nMore chaotic mixes need more compression. Compression will stabilize sounds, giving them more presence. \n- You might to decide to compress one sound moreso to give it more relative presence, or you may decide to compress everything to increase overall presence of the mix\n\nAdding heavy compression to a sound and then turning up the volume is a technique that can do 2 different things:\n- make a sound front and centre (e.g. electric guitar)\n- prevent a softer sound from being lost in the mix\n    - [ref](https://youtu.be/TEjOdqZFvhY?t=3059)\n\n### Bring sound elements closer/further away from listener\nAs explained [[here|music.engineering.mixing.volume#volume-as-a-measure-of-depth-control]], volume alone does not do a sufficient job of letting the engineer move sounds closer/further away from the listener.\n\nNote: the following is a rough guide\n\nto bring a sound element closer in the mix:\n- set ratio somewhere around 3:1 to 6:1\n- set a threshold so that gain reduction is only around -2dB to -3dB\n- set an [[RMS|music.engineering.mixing.volume#rms-root-mean-square]] value of between 200-250\n- add in as much gain as required from the wet output fader.\n\nto push a sound element back in the mix:\n- set ratio somewhere around 8:1 to 16:1\n- set a threshold so that gain reduction is engaged most of the time, with gain reduction of around -6dB to -10dB\n- set an [[RMS|music.engineering.mixing.volume#rms-root-mean-square]] value of 0\n- add between 1dB-3dB of gain to the wet output fader.\n\nto bring a sound element up front in the mix\n- use settings similar to those suggested for pushing sound elements back in the mix\n- add in a lot of gain with the wet output fader (around 9dB, or even more)\n\n## How to use it?\nA ratio of 4:1 and threshold of 6dB gain reduction is usually a good place to start\n\n### Mix Bus\nAttack + Release times are crucial on the mix bus\n\nNormally set at a 4:1 ratio\n\nSSL G compressor is industry standard\n\nslower attack times will give you more punch, but faster attack times will grab things and help glue them together\n    \n## Types of compressor\nThere are 2 types of compressor\n- downward\n- Upward \n\nDownward compression reduces the volume of loud sounds above a certain threshold. This is the more common type of compression. \n\nUpward compression increases the volume of quiet sounds below a certain threshold.\n\nThreshold timing behavior is subject to attack and release settings. When the signal level goes above threshold, compressor operation is delayed by the attack setting. For an amount of time determined by the release after the input signal has fallen below the threshold, the compressor continues to apply dynamic range compression.\n\nThe amount of gain reduction is determined by ratio: a ratio of 4:1 means that if input level is 4 dB over the threshold, the output signal level is reduced to 1 dB over the threshold. The gain and output level has been reduced by 3 dB. Another way of stating this is that any input signal level over the threshold will, in this case, be output at a level which is only 25% (i.e. 1 over 4) as much over the threshold as its input level was.\n\nThe highest ratio of ∞:1 is known as *limiting*, and effectively denotes that any signal above the threshold is brought down to the threshold level once the attack time has expired.\n\n### Expansion\nSome compressors also have the ability to do the opposite of compression, namely expansion. Expansion increases the dynamic range of the audio signal. Like compression, expansion comes in two types, downward and upward.\n\nDownward expansion make the quiet sounds below the threshold even quieter. A noise gate can be thought of as an extreme form of downward expansion as the noise gate make the quiet sounds (for instance: noise) quieter or even silent\n\nUpward expansion make the louder sounds above the threshold even louder.\n\n### Compressing before or after EQ\nusing EQ in front of your compressor produces a warmer, rounder tone, while using EQ after your compressor produces a cleaner, clearer sound. So, the question you need to ask yourself for each channel in your mix is, “Do I want to EQ the compressed signal or do I want to compress the EQed signal? What sound do I want for this signal?”\n\n* * *\n\n### Where in the FX chain to use compressor.\nCompressors should typically be applied after subtractive [[EQ|music.engineering.mixing.EQ]]\n- imagine we had a singer who grabbed the mic when singing, resulting in a low rumble at sporadic points in the song. Since a compressor doesn't know the difference about frequencies, the low rumble would cause all frequencies to duck. Therefore, we must EQ out the rumble first so the compressor doesn't get triggered and lower the volume of all frequencies.\n\nSounds with harsh transients (e.g. handclaps, snare) can be tamed with a compressor with _slow attack_ in order to allow a portion of the transient through. Afterwards, apply additive EQ (~2000 hZ for handclaps) to make the sound more apparent.\n- if we had applied the additive EQ before compression, that boost could push the compressor in an unwanted way, and actually negate the EQ's effect.\n\n## UE Resources\n- [How to hear compression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0XGXz6SHco)\n- [Parallel Compression](https://www.soundonsound.com/techniques/parallel-compression)","n":0.028}}},{"i":190,"$":{"0":{"v":"Techniques","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n### Multi-stage compression (a.k.a serial compression)\nMulti-stage compression involves using multiple compressors each applying a few dB of gain reduction.\n- ex. when compressing vocals, we may apply the first compressor (a fast compressor) to tame the sharpest peaks in the dynamic range, then we might apply another compressor (a slow compressor) to \"glue\" everything together.\n\nThe result is that we retain the same amount of control, but because each compressor isn't working as hard, we get a much more natural sound.\n- therefore, this technique is used to preserve the natural tone that our sound has, while still getting the compression we're after.\n\nDifferent attack and release times are a good idea\n- use fast attack/release times on first compressor to control transients\n- use medium attack/release times on 2nd/3rd to shape the tone\n\n[How to](https://www.musicianonamission.com/vocal-compression-how-to-compress-vocals/)\n\n### Parallel compression\nParallel compression is blending an uncompressed sound with a heavily compressed sound\n- we must determine the appropriate level of blending to find the desired balance between control and naturalness.\n\nParallel compression pushes a track forward and makes it sound bigger or more aggressive\n\nThe benefit of using parallel compression is that it allows the engineer to achieve a more even and consistent sound while still preserving the natural dynamics and character of the original signal. By blending the compressed signal with the original signal, the engineer can achieve the desired level of compression without completely squashing the dynamics of the sound.\n\nSounds great on vocals that just aren't sitting well in a mix and are getting buried.\n- here, when the uncompressed track drops below a threshold, the compressed track comes up and makes the track sound fatter.\n\nIn your DAW, make a copy of the track you want to parallel compress and put a compressor on it. You’ll want to hit it hard, so exaggerate your compressor’s settings even to the point in which it doesn’t sound pleasant and starts to distort.\n\nMake sure the original track is at the desired level, and bring up the compressed copy’s fader until it sits just beneath the original. Parallel compression gives the impression of control without sounding completely squashed. It’s a fantastic way to compress vocals, but works with almost any individual instrument, too!\n\n### Sidechain compression\nSidechain compression is a type of compression where the effect level on one instrument is controlled by the volume level of another instrument. \n\nA typical use-case is on tracks that compete in the same frequency space.\n- ex. make the compression level on a bass guitar controlled by the output volume of the kick drum. The idea is that when the kick drum sounds, the bass guitar gets more compressed so that it can stay audible in the mix.\n- ex. imagine you had a bass synth sound along with a kick drum every measure. In order to make the kick drum more present and punchy, we duck the sound of the bass synth every time the kick drum is hit.\n\nBecause this affects how 2 or more similar-frequency sounds sit together in a mix, this is something we want to do before EQ.\n- in other words, this allows us to give each instrument its space without messing with the frequencies.\n\nThe general way we achieve sidechain compression is by \n- opening up additional channels on the track we want to compress\n- sending the signal from our trigger track (ie. the track that will trigger the compression to occur) into those newly opened channels\n- setting the compressor plugin to apply only in response to those signals \n\nSide-chain compression has prominent usage in dance music\n\n#### Example: Reaper usage\nsay you want your bass track to compress (or duck) a little to let your kick drum occupy the primary space of that frequency in those moments...\n\nwhat you would do is go to your bass track and click the i/o button (input output). within that you will see a receive section, add your kick drum. now go slightly below that and change the output of the from 1/2 to 3/4 (this will be an aux output you will recognize with your compresson in the next step)\n\nnow go to your bass effects and add a reacomp (reaper compression) to the front of your chain. inside your compressor effects you will see a drop menu for the aux 3/4 (this is where your kick was sent. now solo your kick and bass tracks (just to audition for now), make sure to set your ratio, drop your threshold to a desired db, and watch the kick duck the signal down when it plays.\n\nbasically the bass track now contains both the bass signal and the kick drum signal but the kick signal (on the bass track) is routed to outputs that aren't being sent to the master, which triggers the compressor\n\n#### Ducking\nDucking is an effect commonly used in dubbed foreign films, where an actor speaking in a foreign language will get quieter once the dubbed voice comes in. The original actor's voice is linked to the overdubbed voice and will decrease in volume when the overdubbed voice reaches a certain volume level.\n\nAnother example is for use by DJ, whereby when he starts speaking, the music decreases in volume.\n\nDucking is an effect that is achieved with a compressor's sidechain input.\n\nDucking can also be used to achieve the well-known and very popular 'pumping' effect\n\n#### De-essing\nDe-essing is a technique achieved through side-chain compression\n\n### Multiband compression\nA multiband compressor is a compressor that works on a specific set of frequency ranges, instead of the whole track.\n\nYou can actually use a multiband compressor in place of an EQ, and in some cases they are more effective than EQs\n- in fact, in cases where you want to radically alter a sound, a multiband compressor may be the way to go.\n\nnote: Multiband compression must be used with care as it can easily destroy a mix.\n- it's been said not to use multiband compression if you are getting your music mastered by someone else.\n\nExamples:\n- ReaXComp","n":0.032}}},{"i":191,"$":{"0":{"v":"Parameters","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n### Threshold\nThe threshold determines what is to be selected by the compressor (which would be everything louder than the threshold)\n\n### Ratio\nThe ratio determines by how much we will squeeze down the selected parts\n\n### Gain\nThe gain determines how much volume will be added back to *everything*\n\n### Attack\nAttack determines how quickly compression will kick in when the dB threshold has been met.\n\nThink of attack as letting you shape the transient of a sound. Adding punch (slower attack) or removing punch (faster attack) as you adjust the attack time.\n- ie. the compressor lets you control the size, speed, texture, tone of the transient.\n\nAttack time is tweaked to manage the impact of transients but transients have almost nothing to do with our perception of loudness, which is a much slower impression than our impression of impact.\n\nAttack is a way to control how punchy the sound is\n- with a slower attack, we let more of the punchiness th\n\nThe slower the attack speed, the more of the transient we are letting through.\n- this results in a more punchy sound. More focus is on the hits of the instrument\n- generally speaking, slow attack is better for percussive sounds\n\nThe faster the attack speed, the less sound we are letting through on the initial burst\n- this results in a more mellow sound. More focus is on what follows from the hits\n- generally speaking, fast attack is better for more melodic parts\n\nIf you have a lead instrument in a dense mix, it can be a good idea to let some more attack through (longer attack time), since it allows us to follow the melody a little closer\n- if we have a sparse mix, we may want to shorten the attack so that the transients don't poke through the layers.\n\ntip: to hear what the attack is really doing to the sound, turn the volume of your mix to an almost imperceptible level. At this point, you should be able to hear changes you make to the attack setting.\n- this is because our perceptual system acts like a natural compressor at high volumes\n\n### Release\nRelease determines how quickly the compressor will recover from gain reduction.\n\nRelease lets us control the movement of the compression.\n\nFast releases can be perceived as brighter and more aggressive\n- generally speaking, fast release is better for more percussive, punchy sounds\n\nSlow releases make the sound darker and a little smoother, and make the compression feel more relaxed.\n- https://youtu.be/K0XGXz6SHco?t=1034\n- slow release times on a track with strong dynamics (e.g. lead vocals) can result in unwanted compression on quieter passages, resulting in an unwanted stuttering effect.\n    - if we have too slow of a release time, then loud parts that trigger the compressor will take too long to recover, and will end up applying the gain reduction to the subsequent quiet parts, sort of defeating the purpose of the compressor.\n\nConsider a compressor on a drum beat track with kick-snare-ride.\n- With a fast release, each time the (louder) kick and snare were hit, the ride would duck very quickly, since the kick and snare are being grabbed by the compressor.\n    - https://youtu.be/K0XGXz6SHco?t=750\n- With a slow release, the ride takes some time to get back to its highest volume level again, after each time the kick and snare hits. This creates kind of a swell effect on the cymbals themselves.\n    - https://youtu.be/K0XGXz6SHco?t=798\n\n### Knee size\nknee is about the interaction between a compressor’s threshold and ratio settings.\n\nKnee size smooths the way the compressor reacts to the signal\n\nKnee size determines whether the compressor kicks in suddenly or gently.\n- a low setting (ie. Hard Knee) of 0dB ensures that the full compression ratio is applied the instant the threshold is exceeded.\n- a high setting will result in the compression being applied more gradually.\n\nKnee size blurs the line of the threshold\n- ex. 3db knee size means that 3db under the threshold is where the compressor begins to react, increasingly towards the real threshold value. This causes the compressor to start reacting in small amounts early, so it is less obvious where it starts.\n\n## Misc\nIf you don't know where to start, start with a high ratio so you can really hear the effects of what the attack and release are doing.\n\n## Resources\n- [Interactive compression soundwave visualizer](https://codepen.io/animalsnacks/full/VRweeb?fbclid=IwAR2CE0K03deuAOMT8Ccdy9-B80iJJJCjAyiYD3AeZUvYegZrY8arhx6JJfU)\n- [visualization of how each compression param affects an audio signal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gNRGqHzMKc)\n\n* * *\n\n### Mom music analogy\n- Threshold - The volume at which your mom tells you to cut down your music\n- Ratio - The amount you cut down your music when she tells you to (the threshold)\n- Attack - How FAST you cut it down when she tells you to (the threshold)\n- Release - How quickly you cut the music back up when she leaves the room\n","n":0.036}}},{"i":192,"$":{"0":{"v":"Bass","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nmost commonly panned center, since it commands so much attention\n\nJazz oftentimes place the bass off to one side\n- normally done if the sound of the bass is thinner\n\nIn a typical pop situation with the snare on 2 and 4 A common 'trick' used to help tighten a groove between bass and drums is to leave a \"hole\" for the snare hit: sustain your notes right up to the snare hit, and then stop it *just* before the hit.\n\n### Compression\nCompress somewhere around 4:1\n\nUse fast attack time if the bass player is inconsistent with dynamic range (ie. playing loud in some parts and quiet in others)\n\nUse a long release time when final bass notes taper off too fast, combined with a moderate ratio (e.g. 6:1)\n\n### EQ\nIf bass sounds a little dull, experiment with:\n\n| instrument | 40-60Hz | 200-400Hz | 1000-3000Hz | 5000-8000Hz | 10000-12000Hz |\n|------------|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------------|\n| Bass       | +2dB    | -4dB      |             |             |               |\n\n### Try\n#### Geddy Lee tone\nFeed a single bass signal into 2 separate Aux tracks, then blend:\n1.

EQ the sound in isolation\n  - this is primarily done to change the sound of the instrument, and potentially make it sound more interesting (which might mean less natural).\n  - not every instrument needs EQ at this stage\n  - the boundaries within which you can be creative with EQ is limited. Extreme reverb and extreme delay can be used to great effect in a mix, but outside the parameters of what is considered \"right\", EQ can quite easily sound bad.\n2. EQ the sound as part of the whole mix\n  - this approach is necessary\n\nIt is generally considered uncommon for specific sounds to change EQ during a mix ([ref](https://youtu.be/TEjOdqZFvhY?t=7674))\n- it can be done, but it is very noticeable. Aqualung (Jethro Tull; vocals) and Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd; the acoustic guitar) are good examples of this.\n\nIt is advisable to be wary of advice to \"always mix a certain instrument in a certain way\". Instead, each suggestion needs to make sense given the circumstances (ie. what genre of song you have, how the mics were placed etc.)\n\n### Relative EQ\nConsider the idea that we can view volume as a *relative* function that is made up of all tracks occuring simultaneously. \n- That is, the only \"loudness\" of a sound is how loud it is compared to the others. \n\nThis is much the same for EQ, and we can compare the relative EQ of each sound at each frequency range.\n- we can create various EQ relationships at each frequency range (highs, mid-range and low)\n- spec: that means we can mix the lows as a cluster, the mids as a cluster, and so on\n\n### Mirrored Equalization\nInstruments with similar frequency (such as bass guitar and kick drum) will compete with each other in the mix. Mirrored equalization is the process of boosting one and cutting the other so that they both stand out.\n\n## How do we do it?\n1. ⁠Try to EQ everything to sit right in the biggest section (presumably the chorus or bridge), and work backwards from there.\n2. ⁠Try volume automation before you start automating EQ.\n3. ⁠If volume automation can’t get the right balance, maybe try splitting some instruments or vocals into Verse and Chorus tracks. I find this easier to manage than parameter automation.\n4. ⁠If that still isn’t enough then maybe go for EQ automation. But keep it simple. 90% of the battle of mixing is getting in control of the balance; you don’t want to overcomplicate things.\n5. ⁠Can’t overstate how each part’s melodic range (top to bottom) contributes to a good EQ balance. I find if I’m EQing drastically, it’s most likely a musical problem that needs to be addressed. E.g. if two instruments are playing in the same melodic range as the vocal... no amount of EQ is going to solve that musical problem.\n\nIt is generally a good idea to sequentially EQ sounds that occupy a similar frequency space.\n- ex. After EQing mandolin, we might want to EQ the lead acoustic guitar, which will allow us to more methodically carve out sufficient frequency space for each instrument.\n\n## Frequency Spectrum\nSee p.76 of ReaMix for all frequency ranges and the special attention each much be paid to successfully EQ.\n\n### Presence zone\nThe \"presence zone\" is found in the frequency range of 2.5-5 kHz.\n\n2.5-5 kHz is the frequency range the human ear is most sensitive to. It’s what your listeners pick up on first and remember best. Any sounds within that range will be more easily heard by your ears, and sound closer to you.\n- because of this, a 1dB boost in this area might be comparable to a 3dB boost in any other range, which is why we have to take care boosting in this area.\n  - this concept can be illustrated by the Fletcher Munson curve, which illustrates what dB boost we need to give at each frequency in order to attain the same level of perceived loudness (measured in *phon*s). We see that the curve rises on both the low end and high end, showing that we can't easily hear low frequency sounds or high frequency sounds.\n  - we can use this graph to get an idea of how sensitive each dB boost in EQ for a given region will affect the perceived loudness. Clearly, around 3000Hz-4000Hz we need to boost very gently.\n![](/assets/images/2022-09-17-10-44-37.png)\n\nMaking room in the presence zone for lead vocals is a classic choice. But whatever element of your mix you want front and center should occupy some of the presence zone if possible.\n\n## Filters\n\n### High-pass filter\n- A high-pass (aka low cut) filter passes higher frequencies well but attenuates (cuts or decreases) lower-frequency components. \n- a *rumble filter* is a high-pass filter that cuts out the low frequency end of human hearing (20-40 Hz range)\n\n### Low-pass filter\n- A low-pass (aka high cut) filter passes low-frequency components of signals while attenuating higher frequencies.\n\n### Shelving filter\n- A shelving filter can be used to reduce or increase signals above or below a set frequency\n  - any time we see bass and treble knobs on a speaker, these are shelving filters.\n\n## Corrective EQ\n#### Boominess\nIf an instrument sounds too \"boomy\", take off a few dB around 200Hz\n\n#### Muddiness\nIf an instrument sounds too \"muddy\", cut the level around 300Hz\n\n#### Irritation\nEspecially with percussive instruments, where this occurs try cutting around 2000Hz-4000Hz range.\n\n#### Twanginess\nCan occur with plucked instruments. Cut volume around 1000Hz-4000Hz range.\n\n#### Thinness\nWhere an instrument sounds too thin, try reducing volume around 5000Hz-8000Hz range.\n\n#### Hiss\nWhere an instrument sounds \"hissy\", try rolling off above the 8000Hz mark.\n\n\n* * *\n\n## Tips\nRename the instance of the EQ FX to describe what its purpose is (ex. `EQ: Fix Muddiness`, `EQ: Add presence`). Make this the first plugin in the chain, then consider this FX instance to be locked.\n- this is a general tip for any FX.\n\nIn most cases the low-low end of the frequency spectrum should be cut, even if it is a bass instrument.\n- therefore, we should enable a high pass filter and sweep until the tone of the instrument starts to change, then back off. You shouldn't really notice a difference between the before and after\n- we don't really hear these frequencies anyway, and they only really produce an energy that can contribute to muddiness.\n  - this isn't the case for some genres like EDM.\n\nConsider what happens when you boost the frequency range that your transients sit at. You are essentially doing the opposite of what a compressor does. While a compressor will reduce the dynamic range of a sound (ie. make the loudest part quieter, which is the transient), boosting that frequency range will have the opposite effect.\n\nConsider the different components of a single sound. When EQing, try and make all the individual sounds of a given source stand on its own. Make it so you can hear each component of the sound clearly. This usually is achieved by removing frequencies that are not part of these main components.\n- ex. a bass not only has the main tone, but also the sound of the fingers on the strings\n- ex. a kick drum not only has the \"boom\" sound, but also the sound of the beater on the drumskin. Since the boom sound is at a low frequency and the beater is at a higher frequency, we can usually boost the beater frequency a bit, and cut a bit between the beater and the \"boom\"\n\n## Questions\nIs it a bad idea to put a double tracked instrument (e.g. vocals) into a bus, and apply EQ to the bus? Or should be EQ each take with its own instance of the FX? even if we just copy and paste it over.\n\n## Resources\n- [Frequencies of instruments](https://www.teachmeaudio.com/mixing/techniques/enhancement-frequencies)\n- [Kush: stop sweeping EQ; learn frequencies instead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLhxBMxxi7E)\n\n","n":0.027}}},{"i":195,"$":{"0":{"v":"Midi","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nMidi is a protocol\n\nStands for *musical instrument digital interface*\n\nMidi events are the building blocks of a Midi part.\n- with virtual drums, each hit is an event.\n- each event carries information about the note: its velocity, its pitch, vibrato level, pan etc. \n\nA MIDI file essentially a giant list of events, and values for the events.\n\nA single MIDI link through a MIDI cable can carry up to sixteen channels of information, each of which can be routed to a separate device or instrument\n\nEvery midi event has a value range of 0-127\n\nWhen you first learn MIDI, you learn perhaps its most common application: playing virtual instruments.

Meaning for every channel, you can control 128 values, or \"128 different knobs, sliders, switches.\"\n\nCC is used to extend the range of functionality of a MIDI message.\n\nManufacturers of MIDI controllers assign unique CC numbers to each knob/encoder and are immutable.\n\n- ex. a hardware synthesizer filter cutoff could be controlled using MIDI CC, without having to physically turn the knob. \n- ex. a Roland drumkit can be configured to give greater control over which part of the drum was hit.\n\n### Plug-in pin connector\nWe have 2 parts: the input channel and the output channel\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-04-05-11-31-49.png)\n- When we use stereo, we need 2 channels, so the above image could correspond to one instrument. \n\n### Step recording\n- This method of recording MIDI lets us enter midi notes, then automatically jump to the next column in the grid (of piano roll). Put another way, it is perfectly in time.\n- ex. we have a 4/4 song and we define each step as a quarter note. We decide to record the kick drum, so we hit the midi key. That key press will be recorded, and then the position in the song will move to the next quarter note. Again if we hit the midi key, that will be recorded and the position of the cursor will move to the next quarter not\n- Doing it in this way by nature will result in the sound being robotic, since it is perfect timing.\n- The velocity is tracked when we hit the midi keys\n\n### Quantize\n- Quantizing is a concept that accomplishes the problem: how do we take our badly timed midi track and make the notes fit perfectly with the tempo?\n- when we are laying down a midi track, we can quantize the notes so that they are perfectly aligned with the grid. This alignment will depend on how granular the grid currently is.\n- we can decide which part of the note will line up to the grid\n    - position (start of note), end of note, whole note length, and any\n\tcombination of the preceding.\n- We can also determine how close to the grid it will be with `Strength`. Using 100% will make it perfect, but this can detract from some of the expression\n    that comes through the playing of a skilled musician.\n- We can permit the notes to align to the grid on either side, which by default will be fully checked.\n\n### Simulating Legato with stringed instruments\n- ex. hammer on, pull off\n- allow the first note to overlap the second note slightly. This will reduce the\n    staccato nature of the guitar, and make it sound like a smoother transition.\n- Another method is to use pitch bends, but don't make them smooth. Make the pitch bends quantized at semitones. It sounds realistic for slides/pull-offs/hammer-ons.\n","n":0.037}}},{"i":196,"$":{"0":{"v":"Mastering","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nAssuming you aren't working with a bad mix, mastering is fairly objective.\n\n## Recommended mastering studios\n- https://www.cpsmastering.com\n- http://breakpointmastering.com/\n- https://michaelwynneaudio.com/mastering/","n":0.236}}},{"i":197,"$":{"0":{"v":"Imaging","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n## Mono\nMono (short for monophonic) means one channel of audio. \n- when recording a microphone into an audio interface using one microphone and one channel, that is the definition of mono\n\nWhen we have a mono signal in our DAW, eventually it gets sent to a stereo bus.

If this process takes >100ms, it will be noticeable.\n- in a video editor, our input to the program is to make edits. The nature of this is that our workflow is a cycle of making some edits, then playing it back. 100ms is too short a period of time to notice it in this workflow. \n\n### How audio gets from the DAW to studio monitors\nThe DAW provides a continuous stream of digital audio data \n- this data is transferred in chunks of data at a time, called the *buffer size* (set as an audio interface parameter)\n\nthe buffer size is related to the responsiveness of the system, because once the audio is moved into the buffer, it times time to do the conversion  \n- spec: therefore, the amount time the audio files take to be converted to an analog signal serves as a bottleneck\n- because the DAW needs to respond quickly to this buffered audio data, the buffer size must be very small, and therefore refilled very often, because the DAW can only fill one buffer at a time.\n    - therefore, decreasing buffer size increases the responsiveness of the system. However, a shorter buffer means that the other elements of the system must be correspondingly more efficient in order to ensure that the CPU isn't locked up for too long (recall that CPUs multitask and handle many different requests seemingly at the same time, but actually does so sequentially)\n        - \"other elements\" here might consist of, video cards, audio interfaces, network interfaces (espectially wireless interfaces), USB controllers, disk controllers\n            - often the problem lies in a video card or sound card, which is why installing new drivers is normally the first thing to do when a performance issue like this arises.\n- by increasing the audio buffer size, we are essentially increasing the window of opportunity for the CPU to fill it.\n    - therefore, if we are having pops and crackles that are caused by devices that deliver audio files to the computer, increasing the buffer size is essentially slowing down the train to give the CPU a chance deliver all of the expected audio data on time.\n\nWhen a problem device (e.g. audio interface/driver) locks up the CPU, the DAW can't properly fill each buffer, the audio data has a gap in it, or worse, a garbled mess of random data. As the sound card receives this corrupted data, this is manifested as pops, clicks, crackles\n- other times, the computer will just put everything on pause until the buffer is filled— in which case playback will produce a stutter.\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-09-13-14-39-28.png)\n\nspec: an audio buffer size can be measured in ms or mb.\n- if my buffer is 200ms it means that it will\n\n### Fixing problems related to crackling/popping\n- check for latest drivers (note: the latest driver is not always the best for your system.)\n- Ensure buffer size is not too small.\n    - the more tracks in your project, the higher your buffer needs to be\n- Ensure that sampling rate is not too high. (a sensible default on many systems is 44.1khZ)\n    - if sample rate is higher, then buffer size needs to be correspondingly bigger.\n- use a latency checker with the input devices, and see if anything pops out.

This concept is what gives us our amplitude (loudness) \n\n## How sound travels\n- Sounds are brought to our ears by air. When an object (ex. guitar string) moves, it disturbs the air around it. More specifically, it disrupts the natural motion of air molecules near the object. Those disturbed molecules in turn disturb their neighbors, and so on, in a ripple effect.\n- The disturbance of these air molecules forms a pattern that permeates in all direction outward. This pattern effectively becomes an entity itself, which we call a soundwave. \n- Consider at a stadium when fans do *The Wave*. Each person effectively influences the movement of the person beside them, and so on down the line. In effect, that wave has become its own entity. This is the sound wave.\n- If the movement of an object (guitar string) is rapid and regular (ie. consistent), then regular soundwaves will be produced. This is the type of sound that produces tones (a sound with a particular pitch). We associate this type of sound with music.\n    - note: tone here is used in a physics sense. \n## Noise vs Tone\n- Imagine taking a handful of stones and dropping them into a pond. Each would make its own wave, and those waves would go outward in all directions, crashing into the other waves and distrupting their natural path and canceling them out. This is analogous to noise, which is basically disorganized sound waves (or more simply, disorganized sound). \n\n![](/assets/images/2021-03-27-19-34-01.png)\n\n## Timbre\n- def - the characteristic difference in sound between instruments. \n- Timbre is created due to the unique combination of different level harmonics. \n    - ex. a clarinet might have relatively loud 3rd and 8th harmonics. This unique combination is what gives the clarinet its tone. \n\n## Why certain notes sound good together\n- Say someone plays a note, a middle C. Now someone else plays the note that is twice the frequency of the middle C. Since this second note was already a harmonic of the first note, the sound waves of the two notes reinforce each other and sound good together. \n- These are the harmonics found in the A note:\n```\nA A E A C# E G A\n1 2 3 4 5  6 7 8\n```\n* * *\n\n- when a sound wave encounters a wall, it does one of 2 things:\n    - It bounces (reflection)\n    or\n    - It bends (refraction)\n- waves can be trapped by multiple objects facing each other, resulting in standing waves.\n    - this is how musical instruments achieve pitch (how sharp or flat something is, in a relative sense) \n- When a musical tone is played, only a particular set of frequencies is heard. So when you play a note on a piano, what is heard is actually a blend of multiple pitches.\n    - These pitches are called harmonics. They give the sound its timbre.\n\n# Frequency\n- all sound waves travel at about the same speed. This means that waves with a shorter wavelength (ie. higher pitch) will arrive at your ear more frequently.\n- This aspect of sound (how often a wave gets to your ear) is called frequency.\n- Musicians use the term *pitch*.\n\n### Harmonic Frequencies\nbelow: the red line represents a sine wave, whereas the superimposed black wave is a guitar. The guitar wave generally follows the sine wave, but there are bumps. The space between the black wave and the red one are the harmonic frequencies that are put out by the guitar.\n![](/assets/images/2022-09-18-15-25-20.png)\n\nIt is the unique harmonic frequencies of each sound that give it its timbre.\n\nbelow: the soundwave recorded with a microphone at the soundhole will produce a wave that is much more similar to the sine wave.\n![](/assets/images/2022-09-18-15-30-39.png)\n\ncompare this to a microphone at the neck.\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-09-18-15-32-20.png)\n\nThis is because the fundamental frequencies are accented over the soundhole, whereas the harmonic frequencies are accented over the neck.\n\nThe illustrates how playing an A on guitar and an A on a clarinet will produce the exact same fundamental— it is the harmonics that give each sound its unique timbre.\n\nbelow: an A on guitar. Notice the fundamental frequency as the leftmost peak, while the others are harmonic frequencies.\n- notice that they get closer together as we move higher up the frequency spectrum.\n- also notice that past a certain point, harmonics start to become more faint.\n![](/assets/images/2022-09-18-15-39-06.png)\n\nA soundwave that has no harmonic, is a sine wave.\n- therefore all harmonics are sine waves.\n\nThe first 6 harmonics (ie. fundmental+5 overtones) make up a major chord.\n\nbelow: every harmonic note that isn't an octave of the fundamental is slightly out of tune.\n- here \"out of tune\" is in the context of *equal temperament*, whereby an octave is split into 12 evenly spaced frequency ranges and each represented by a note. Acoustically, the 12 frequency ranges are not equal. Consider that we can describe relationships between tones with ratios (octave is 2:1, 4:3 is a 4th, a tritone is 45:32 etc.). Many of these ratios yield an irrational frequency number. This system of tuning is called *just intonation*.\n    - spec: ex. Middle C is at ~260Hz. A perfect 4th (4:3) from C would be at 346.666Hz (260 * 4 / 3)\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-09-18-16-06-39.png)\n\nNaturally, if we were using the just intonation method of tuning, our notes would all be perfectly in tune.\n\n### Equal Temperament\nIf we are tuning our guitar with a tuner, then our instrument is tuned according to *equal temperament*. If we are using harmonics to tune, then we are using *just intonation*. \n\nNotes in equal temperament aren't the most pleasing \"versions\" of those notes, but they will sound approximately right in any context.\n- this is why if we make our open C chord perfectly in tune and then go play an E chord, it sounds out of tune.\n- for this reason, it might be advisable to tune to concert pitch with a tuner, then make any fine adjustments needed to make the guitar sound good in whatever key you're playing in.\n\n* * *\n\n## Inverse Square Law of Sound\nThe inverse square law states that \"with every doubling of distance away from the sound source, the sound will be four times less intense.\" \n- Consider that we can visualize sound as an expanding sphere, since it will extend out in all directions from the source. After a sound has been made, the same amount of energy will exist in that sphere no matter if we are close to the source (small sphere), or if we are further away (larger sphere). Therefore, the larger the sphere is, the more surface area the energy must be spread over, resulting in less energy at any single point.\n- Also consider that when we double the radius of a sphere, the surface area quadruples. This means that when we move from 1m to 2m away from a sound source, the strength of the sound wave at any single point on the surface of the sphere is actually 1/4. Since our ears/microphones only pick up sound from a small portion of the entire surface area of the soundwave, this effectively means that the sound pressure level of that soundwave is 4x less as we double our distance from that sound source.\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-10-14-09-13-02.png)\n\n\n### Questions?\n- is it that as there are overlapping harmonics in common between the two notes, the more consonant they sound together?\n\n## Resources\n- [Acoustic room treatment software](https://www.roomeqwizard.com/)\n    - need 2 special kind of microphones explicitly for this purpose, which cost around $200 total\n\n# Related\n- [[science.sound]]\n","n":0.028}}},{"i":205,"$":{"0":{"v":"Soundwave","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nSound is energy in motion\n- when someone hits a drum with a stick, energy is being converted from one form to another.\n  - when the arm is lifted, the body is giving it potential energy. When the arm moves toward the drum, it has kinetic energy. As the stick strikes the drum, the drumskin sucks up most of the energy and starts to vibrate. Since that drumskin is now the thing that is moving, it now has the kinetic energy, so it starts to vibrate. As that skin vibrates, it pushes air molecules that are in contact with it. Each moving air molecule pushes its neighbors, creating a ripple effect until all the air molecules in the room are vibrating. Inside your ear, the vibrating air molecules make tiny hairs vibrate. The hairs stimulate nerve cells, which send signals to your brain—and your brain perceives these signals as sounds.\n\nTwo key properties of a sound determine how it sounds\n1. The frequency (how many times the wave vibrates in one second) is broadly related to the pitch of the sound we hear. So we hear a high-frequency sound as having a higher pitch. In other words, a choir boy's voice produces a mixture of sound waves of generally higher frequency than an adult man's voice. \n2. The amplitude (volume) of a sound is related to the amount of energy that the sound waves carry. When you bang a drum hard, you make more energetic sound waves with more amplitude that you hear as louder sounds.\n\n## Properties of a soundwave\n![](/assets/images/2022-07-18-18-53-40.png)\n\nWe hear multiple frequencies, but the main one we hear is the fundamental.\n- All sounds can be broken down by each individual sine wave (singular frequency) that builds it. \n  - ex. The reason why a clarinet playing middle C sounds different from a piano playing middle C is because the frequencies that make up each sound are different. The notes are the same, the frequencies (harmonics) are different.\n  - therefore, the fundamental of a clarinet playing C sounds the same as the fundamental of a guitar playing C.\n\nThe only time you hear a single pitch is if you are listening to a sine wave. Every instrument and wave form has some kind of overtones which result in the distinctive timbre of said instrument which makes it identifiable.\n\n## Harmonics\n\n| Harmonic           | Frequency | Pitch          |\n|--------------------|-----------|----------------|\n| 10th               | 4400Hz    | C#             |\n| 9th                | 3960Hz    | B              |\n| 8th                | 3520Hz    | A (3rd octave) |\n| 7th                | 3080Hz    | G 1/4 flat     |\n| 6th                | 2640Hz    | E              |\n| 5th                | 2200Hz    | C#             |\n| 4th                | 1760Hz    | A (2nd octave) |\n| 3rd                | 1230Hz    | E              |\n| 2nd                | 880Hz     | A (1st octave) |\n| Root (Fundamental) | 440Hz     | A              |\n\nWhen we play an A note on the guitar (the fundamental), there are also other harmonic sounds that can he heard, each of which is a perfect multiple of the fundamental frequency\n\nCertain combinations of odd numbered harmonics (e.g. 3rd, 5th and 9th(?)) will tend to product a more edgy sound, while the even harmonics will create a more soothing sound.\n\n## Overtone\nOvertones are the strongest at the moment of attack. So if the attack is covered by the rest of the ensemble, and the note is sustained, it can be difficult to tell what instrument is playing the note. In other words, if a clarinet plays a sustained note, but the entire ensemble hits a loud short note at the moment of attack, it will be difficult to tell if the sustained note is played by a clarinet or a trumpet or an oboe or a flute, etc.\n- if you had a chorus of singers singing a chord in perfect tuning, you would hear a tone that is not being sung by any one of the singers. This tone is the overtone.\n  - ex. Stravinsky does it in The Rite of Spring\n\n* * *\n\nSoundwaves are [[longitudinal|science.wave#transverse-vs-longitudinal-waves]]\n\nwhen the soundwave has a constant vibration (such as one originating from an instrument), the movement of the air molecules will disturb those ahead and behind them in such a way that they cause molecules to squeeze together \n\n![](./assets/images/2021-03-27-19-32-58.png)\n\n- This type of wave is difficult to show in a diagram, which is why sound waves are portrayed as transverse \n- A slinky creates waves similar to this\n- try imagining yourself as one of the particles that the wave is disturbing (a water drop on the surface of the ocean, or an air molecule). As the soundwave comes from behind you, its transverse waves lift you up and then drops you down; a longitudinal wave coming from behind pushes you forward and pulls you back.\n- When we are portraying a longitudinal wave as transverse, the \"high point\" of the wave would be when the molecules are more bunched together.\n- when playing a guitar, the string disturbs the air molecules around it as it vibrates, producing sound waves in the air\n\n## Standing Wave\n- Standing refers to the fact that the peaks of the waves don't move toward a direction — though the amplitude does go up and down\n- this phenomenon arises when we confine a wave to a given region. we have a string fixed at both ends. When you pluck a guitar string, the wave travels down the string towards the nut. Once it hits the nut, it reflects back toward the base, though going down the reverse side of the string. Because these waves are continuous, they run into each other at the nodes (where the wave meets the center axis). Standing waves occur when these waves running into each other reinforce one another, as opposed to crashing into each other.\n- The deal with standing waves is that they have to fit perfectly within the boundaries so that the reflected wave will match up perfectly with the nodes that correspond.\n![](/assets/images/2021-03-27-19-33-15.png)\n  - These standing waves are called harmonics.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-03-27-19-33-31.png)\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-03-27-19-33-43.png)\n- The longer the string, the longer the wavelength. With a stringed instrument, the only way to get shorter wavelength harmonics is to shorten the string by fretting. This is how you move from whole to halves to thirds and so on.\n- when you think about it, the with each harmonic, we are dividing the string into 1/2, 1/3 and so on. \n- The fundamental (whole) wave is the one that gives the string its pitch. the other waves produce a series of harmonics. \n- They are what gives the string its rich, musical, string-like sound - its timbre. \n  - (The sound of a single frequency alone is a much more mechanical, uninteresting, and unmusical sound.)\n\n- Anything that produces a tone (ie musical instrument, voice) \n\n## UE Resources\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPbLYD9KFAo\n- [Harmonic series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx_kugSemfY)","n":0.03}}},{"i":206,"$":{"0":{"v":"Envelope","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n## What is it?\nThe envelope of a sound is the journey that the sound takes from its inception to its ultimate completion. In other words, it describes how a sound changes over time.\n- there are various types of envelope\n  - ex. an amplitude envelope describes how the amplitude of a sound changes over time\n    - amp envelopes are most common, particularly when talking about acoustic (ie. non-digital) sounds\n\nconsider the plucking of a guitar string. As we hit the string, the sound reaches its absolute peak.\n\nInstruments don't make sounds the way lamps make light: it's not \"all\" or \"nothing.\"\n- instead, the sound wave is composed of 4 sections:\n![](/assets/images/2023-03-05-16-24-02.png)\n\n## ADSR\nThe combination of ADSR describe how a sound changes over time.\n\n### Attack\nThe attack controls the time taken for the sound to reach its peak from nil.\n- in the case of an amplitude envelope, it is the part of the envelope where amplitude is still increasing. \n  - In other words, it is the time taken for amplitude to reach max level.\n\nMost natural instruments have a very short attack, meaning they reach max amplitude very quickly.\n\nA slow attack can be perceived as a sort of fade-in— as we press the key down, it takes a more significant amount of time before the sound reaches its peak amplitude.\n\n### Decay\nThe decay controls the time taken for the envelope to decrease from its peak to the sustain level. \n- in the case of an amplitude envelope, the part where amplitude starts to decrease. This phase starts as soon as the attack phase reaches its peak.\n- in real spaces high frequencies often decay quite fast while bass frequencies stick around much longer. \n\n### Sustain\nthe period during which amplitude remains constant\n- many natural instruments (e.g. guitar) don't have a sustain phase\n\nWhile attack, decay, and release refer to a length of time, sustain refers to level (e.g. in case of amp envelope, a volume level).\n- often, sustain is quantified by a % of the peak value\n  - ex. with an amplitude envelope, a sustain of 70% means that the sustain phase of the envelope is at 70% of the amplitude of the peak's amplitude value.\n\n### Release\nthe final reduction in amplitude.\n\nOn piano, this would be the time it takes for the sound to reach 0 amplitude after we take our finger off the key.\n\n* * *\n\n### Example: envelopes of different instruments\nex. If you press a piano key and release it, the sound changes volume gradually over time. \n- First, it rises quickly (or \"attacks\") to its maximum volume. \n- Next, the sound \"decays\" to a lower level and stays there or \"sustains.\" \n- Finally, when we let go of the key, the sound \"releases\" and dies down to silence. \n- In a piano, the attack phase is fairly slow and the sustain phase can be really long as the notes take a long time to die away. \n\n- ex. With a flute, the attack phase is quicker and sharper, there is little decay, the sustain continues for as long as the flautist keeps blowing, and the release is also very fast.\n- ex. With the strike of a drum, you have an almost instant attack, a longer decay (depending on what material you're hitting), and effectively no sustain or release.\n","n":0.043}}},{"i":207,"$":{"0":{"v":"Motivation","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n### Numbing\nIt's not what you do; it's why you do it.\n- ex.

If it is to avoid doing something or to avoid feeling something, that should be a red flag\n\nSomething as simple as jotting down a couple of reasons why we are doing something makes it much simpler to start. Motivation is triggered by making choices that demonstrate (to ourselves) that we are in control—and that we are moving toward goals that are meaningful.\n\nWhen our commitment is wavering, the best way to stay on track is to consider the progress we’ve already made.\n\nTo feel more inspiration, we must focus on what we get from what we are seeking, rather than the thing itself\n- ex. We aren't inspired by money. Rather, we are inspired by what the money can get us. It is when we are more conscious of what the money can get us that we feel more inspiration.  \n\nBefore doing something, always ask yourself: does it help me accomplish and move me toward my long-term goals?\n- Even if it's indirectly contributing, it's ok.

When we see a poodle and a pit bull side by side, we don't need to consciously think about the fact that they are both dogs. We just know it intuitively because of the mental framework we have made that is churning under the surface. We know what a dog is, and as a result are able to instantly recognize the pattern and make a judgement.\n- ex. When reading a book, we don't need to spend time decoding what a string of letters means. To become an expert at reading (which most of us are), you had to first learn the correspondence between letters and sounds. At this point, reading was a matter of laboriously sounding out each word. With practice, we came able to recognize strings of characters as a word, with C-A-T no longer being just a string of characters, but a word that encompassed a plethora of knowledge surrounding what we know about cats.\n  - some people are better at others than reading. That is, some are better able to understand and assimilate the information found in books, due to their superior mental representations that allow them to overcome the limitations of short-term memory.\n    - those who are better at reading are those that already understand the subject matter. Consider that to someone who's never seen a dog before, explaining what it is will result in a bunch of facts about an abstract concept that they can't really attach information to. This is much the same with someone who knows nothing about football reading a summary of the game: they would be reading facts that can't properly be assembed in the mind, due to the absense of a proper mental framework that can make sense of them.\n\nMental models also allow us to make inferences on facts that we hold. In effect, the mental framework allows our brains a way to organize and arrange the information in ways that can be used to recognize and solve the problems in front of us.\n- ex. anyone can read medical books and learn facts about something, but it takes the backdrop of a framework that those facts can be attached to in order to make inferences on them.\n- these mental structures can be thought of as \"if..then structures\".\n  - ex. imagine a grandmaster playing chess. They can take one look at the board and get a pretty accurate view of the moves that can be made. They are thinking in terms of \"if..then\", effectively giving them a narrative about hypotheticals.\n\n### First Principles\nFirst Principles are those facts that we know with 100% certainty.

The hippocampus is responsible for combining senses in a way that is convenient for memory.\nOur recollection of individual events is made up of multiple parts of the brain working in tandem. When you are experiencing something, different senses activate different parts of your brain.\n- anal. Imagine a cellist giving a performance. There are many different senses that are active at any given moment. The sound of the cello (auditory cortext), the feel of the fingers on the strings (postcentral gyrus), the look on an audience member’s face (fusiform gyrus), the feel of stage fright (amygdala)... All of these things are joined together by the hippocampus to give a more solidified memory of the experience.\n- this shows that memories are not stored in one place of the brain. This is why there are people who have suffered brain damage to an extent that they can't form new memories, yet they can still go to the store and do their shopping. This is because the muscle memory of doing your shopping takes place in a different part of your brain than the memory of what you ate for breakfast.\n- because the hippocampus is what ties these different memories together to form complete ones, our \"life's story\" is limited by what the hippocampus is able to combine among shards of memories that exist in different parts of the brain.\n\n### Memory doesn't work like a video recorder\nThis understanding of the brain helps illustrate why memory is not analogous to a recording device. Recalling events is not like a video player, where we just load in a memory. Instead, recall has more to do with retrieving these fragments of memory, and combining them with the hippcampus. This all happens in the moment as we are recalling an event.\n- If we had to shoehorn how memory works into the analogy of a recording device, the recording device would work in a bit of a different way. Instead of reading a file and then playing it, the recording device would have to assemble different pieces of related memory from different places of the storage drive. It would then have to reassemble those pieces of memory, filling in the holes that inevitably arise from missing information. This AI does its best to guess how the empty holes should be filled in, but it invariably makes mistakes along the way. In the end, the played-back version of the recording certainly resembles the original, but some information is either wrong, or completely omitted (do you really consider the billboard advertisement when recalling a memory that took place in the train station?)\n\nThe amygdala is the \"emotional\" component to the brain. It sits next to the hippocampus, and enhances the hippocampus' memory creating functionality. This means that when the amgydala is active, our capacity to make memories is enhanced. This helps explain why we remember milestone days, like wedding, birth of child etc.\n- ex. when flashed a group of faces, we tend to remember the faces that show some sort of emotion (eg. anger, happiness).\n\nMnemonic anchors that involve imagery are strongest when they are vivid, peculiar, and exaggerated in size or quantity.\n\n### Peak–end rule\nwe tend to remember flagship moments: the peaks, the pits, and the transitions.\n- The peak–end rule is a specific form of the more general extension neglect and duration neglect.\n\n# UE Resources\n- https://fs.blog/2017/10/how-to-remember-what-you-read/\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_of_memory#Visual_sense_and_spatial_orientation\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system\n\n# Related\n- [[learning]]","n":0.042}}},{"i":210,"$":{"0":{"v":"Meditation","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nIf you were to draw an image of your breath, it would look like a figure eight, not a straight line, because there is continuity as your breath flows in and out.\n\nMeditation is not about getting rid of all thoughts.

Not just the image, but also the sounds, smells, and general overall feeling that goes with it (ex. Huatulco house view). There shouldn't be any great effort that comes with it. This minimal effort should be similar to when we do visualization exercises in mediation.\n\n#### Body scan\nOften in life, our body is doing one thing and our mind is doing something else. The point of meditation is to bring the mind and the body to the same place.\n\n### Mindfulness\nMindfulness is a state of clear non-judgmental and un-distracted attention to the contents of consciousness, whether pleasant or unpleasant.\nmindfulness is about making insightful discoveries about the nature of our own mind.\nmindfulness is not a passive practice\nif you were being mindful, you were being passionate about objectively discerning out what is real in this present moment.\n\nIt's not a matter of thinking more clearly about an experience, it's the act of experiencing more clearly, including the arising of thoughts themselves.\nmindfulness is about recognizing the arising of thoughts and feelings, without being critical of them.\n\nWhen thoughts arise, the purpose is not to eschew them, but is to be almost a third party observer of these thoughts having occurred. When we enter into a discourse with ourselves, we are absorbed with that. Being mindful is about being able to observe those thoughts as they are occurring.\n\nMindfulness is about being no longer perpetually identified with the contents of your thoughts.\n\nConsider a sound that appears for only a moment— be it the creaking of a door, or a beeper going off. This sound exists for only an imperceptibly small moment. It doesn't stay past the point where it's sounding anymore. We simply observe them as they come, and then they are promptly gone. While meditating, we should strive to treat invading thoughts in much the same way— we observe them as they arise, but don't dwell on them.\n\nAny sensory object is an object of mindful meditation. We only use the breath because it is something that is with us at all times.

Instead, we learn them and practice them for the same reason that a soccer player does zig-zag drills and lifts weights. You will never see them do those things on the soccer field, but they will use the strength, speed, insight and flexibility that they built up by doing those drills. Therefore, learning those drills is a part of soccer.\n- And if we don't want to be our proverbial professional soccer player, that's fine! We can still enjoy a game of soccer with friends, and we will be healthier for doing so. Mathematics is the same way. You may not be aiming for a a math-focused career, but math is woven into the way we reason. Knowing mathematics is like wearing X-ray specs that reveal hidden structures underneath the messy and chaotic surface of the world.\n\nWe learn math because it influences our habits of thought. In this sense, it is no different from learning about [[biases|self.bias]] and [[fallacies|logic.fallacy]]: they help us recognize patterns in the world and influence our decision-making for the better.\n- someone well-versed in math is always asking: \"what assumptions are you making? And why are they justified?\"\n\t- ex. someone unfamiliar with [[self.bias.survivorship]] will hear a story like [[Abraham Wald's Aircraft Bullet Holes|self.bias.survivorship#abraham-walds-airplane-bullet-holes]] and will make a set of assumptions. Their naive assumption is that all planes are returning from battle, and that is therefore the denominator in their calculation. Of course, this isn't true, and it causes them to reach a very wrong conclusion.\n- \"math is like an atomic-powered prosthesis that you attach to your common sense, vastly multiplying its reach and strength\"\n\n### Abstraction\nMathematics is all about abstraction. We observe the fingers on our hand and abstract over them the concept of natural numbers. We see how you can take away values from a set and abstract out the concept of negation. We take the concepts of numbers, addition, and negation and abstract them to groups. And so on, and so on.\n- *\"Mathematicians don't just care about finding the answer but developing general problem solving tools and techniques.\"*\n- It's all about boiling down specific applications to their most basic and fundamental properties.\n\nTo be an effective at math, you need to be able to look past all of the empirical application of the problem you are trying to solve and understand the fundamental mathematics that lies behind. In this sense, we focus on the common skeleton shared by different problems that look very different on the surface.\n- ex. if you are able to do this, it becomes apparent when [[biases|self.bias]] are being assumed.\n- sometimes only paying attention to the abstract part of the problem can cause you to ignore features of the problem that really matter\n\n### The problem with how math is taught\nIn school, math is taught as a set of rules that one must obey or you fail. But this is not mathematics. Mathematics is the study of things that come out in a certain way because there is no other way they could possibly be.\n\n### Intuitiveness of math\nAs humans, we have built-in mental systems for assessing the likelihood of an uncertain outcome. But past rudimentary mathematics, those systems are pretty weak and unreliable (especially when it comes to events of extreme rarity).\n\nAddition is the most fundamental of mathematics and also the most intuitive. Without being taught the mathematical rule that $a + b = b + c$, kids know that $5 + 3$ is the same thing as $3 + 5$\n\nBy the same token, one could not say that the mathematical rule of $5 \\times 3 = 3 \\times 5$ is as intuitive, but there is intuition that can be gained once it can be applied to a real-world circumstance. \n- ex. Consider a grid of 8 rows by 6 columns.\n\nNot everything in math can be intuited. For instance, one cannot do calculus by common sense. But calculus is still derived from our common sense. Newton took our intuition about how objects move in straight lines, formalized it, and then built on top of that formal structure a universal mathematical description of motion.\n\n* * *\n\n# Prime numbers\nThe primes are the atoms of number theory, the basic indivisible entities of which all numbers are made.\n- this is because a prime has only 2 factors: 1 and itself\n- All whole numbers greater than 1 are either primes or products of primes.\n- aside from 2, all primes are even\n\n### Resource\n- [prime number primer](https://kids.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/frym.2018.00040)\n\n# Theorem vs Proof\n- theorem is a statement that is expressed in a mathematical language and can be said with certainty to be either valid or invalid.\n\t- For example, the theorem “there are infinitely many prime numbers”. To prove this theorem, it is not enough to point out an additional prime number for a specific given list.\n\t\t- What we need to do is to present a convincing argument why this is the case, rather than just demonstrating the next number in the sequence.\n- a proof on the other hand, requires some definitive reason why the fact that is posited is indeed the truth.\n\t- We can prove that prime numbers are always continuing, because we know that \"all whole numbers are either prime or composite (made up of 2 primes)\". We are able to prove this by picking numbers at random, and verifying that this is true. With each sample, we will have zero variation, and will always be able to either: multiply 2 primes to reach the result, or declare the number a prime\n\n* * *\n\nAn equation is an abstraction that allows the user of the formula to derive a result that they can then use.\n- An equation is a function, functions are basically I/O machines, and abstractions by definition allow us leverage a simpler system to improve productivity.\n\n# Functions\n### Domain\nthe set of values that a function is able to accept. In other words, the function can only accept as inputs (arguments) the values which are included as part of the domain\n- ex. in relational databases, the domain (ie. the boundary/scope) would be the type (int, bool, string etc)\n\n* * *\n\n### Classical Mathematics\nThe underlying idea that underpins everything in classical mathematics is that everything is straight, and made up of simple shapes (circle, square, triangle, pyramid etc.)\n- This philosophy does not lend itself well to the idea of [[fractals|math.fractals]]\n\nTherefore, classical mathematics is only really well suited to study the world that we as humans have created, and it fails to account for the geometry of the natural world.\n\n# UE Resources\n- [Benford's law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXjlR2OK1kM)\n- [more info](https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2017/apr/excel-and-benfords-law-to-detect-fraud.html)\n","n":0.029}}},{"i":212,"$":{"0":{"v":"Theorem","n":1}}},{"i":213,"$":{"0":{"v":"Benfords Law","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\nThe idea is that if you take some set of number data and chop off all numbers after the first one, you will have a predictable distribution of numbers\n- ex. take a large list of airline prices over the course of a year.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-04-11-20-47-22.png)\n\nWhat this curve shows is that ~30% of the numbers will start with a `1`, ~17% with a `2`, and so on.\n\n#### Use in discovery of Enron fraud\nIn an analysis of Enron, it was found that the numbers they reported did not follow the expected curve.\n\n#### Social Media Bots\nIf you analyze friend count among users, you will see a distribution that follows Benford's Law\n- ex.

The [[union|math.set-theory.op.union]] of two sets is a set that contains all elements that appear in either set (ie. if the element appears in either set, then it's part of the union set).\n- ex.

To calculate this, we use the equation: \n\n$speed = {distance \\over time}$\n\n$speed = {0m \\over 0s} = 0$\n\nOur speed can't be calculated by this, because in order to measure speed, we need *some* distance and *some* time.\n- Even the speedometer of a car just shows us an average of how fast we were going for the last (very short) amount of time.\n\nSo we try a different formula, which tells us the distance an object falls over a certain amount of time:\n\n$d = 5t^2$\n\nWhich is a simplified version of:\n\n$d = {1\\over2}gt^2$\n\nBut this doesn't work either, because at $t = 0$, our $d$ results in $0$.\n\nSo to solve this problem, we invent a time **so short that it won't matter**, and we call it $Δt$. Now, we figure out the difference in distance between $t$ and $t + Δt$.\n\nAt 1 second:\n\n$d = 5(1)^2 = 5m$\n\nAt $1 + Δt$ seconds:\n\n$d = 5(1 + Δt)^2$\n\nExpanding,\n\n$d = 5 \\times (1 + Δt)(1 + Δt)m$\n\n$d = 5 \\times (1 + 2Δt + Δt^2)m$\n\n$d = (5 + 10Δt + 5Δt^2)$\n\nSo between 1 second and (1+Δt) seconds we get:\n\n$Δd = (5 + 10Δt + 5Δt^2) - 5m$\n\nAnd change in distance over time:\n\n$Δd/t = {(5 + 10Δt + 5Δt^2) - 5m \\over Δt}$\n\n$Δd/t = 10 + 5Δt$\n\nSo the speed is $10 + 5Δt m/s$, but then we want $Δt$ to be so small that it doesn't matter, so we substitute in zero (an infinitely small number would be inconsequential to the calculation anyway)\n\nTherefore, the speed is exactly $10m/s$\n\n\n","n":0.047}}},{"i":237,"$":{"0":{"v":"Arithmetic","n":1}}},{"i":238,"$":{"0":{"v":"Percentage","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nWhen thinking it terms of percentages, be wary of if a total is being added to, or reduced from.

A conventional approach to this problem is to first find out if the women has the picture through surveillance, then figure out where the picture is through some form of subversiveness. Sherlock was able to logic \"if this woman does in fact have a picture, you'd think (due to its high value), she would keep it in an each to reach spot (people tend to keep valuables within reach in case of emergency)\". Sherlock made up a ruse in order to get in her house, and had an associate fake a fire outside, prompting the woman to go for the photo, thereby confirming both its existence and its hiding place. In this example, Sherlock was able to imagine the state of world that would have to exist if this thing were in fact true.

A logical fallacy stems from an error in a logical argument, while a cognitive bias is rooted in thought processing errors often arising from problems with memory, attention, attribution, and other mental mistakes.\n\nDuring a discussion (no negative connotation), when you have to concede points, it's a good idea to show the audience why the other side's argument is not important or less important to the big picture of your argument. Acknowledging counterarguments contributes to ethos and makes the arguer seem more balanced and fair\n\n* * *\n\n## List of fallacies\n### Analyzing inductive reasoning\nTake the following syllogism:\n- **P1**: If each man had a definite set of rules of conduct by which he regulated his life he would be no better than a machine.\n- **P2**: However, there are no such rules.\n- **C**: Therefore, men cannot be machines.\n\nThis is a non-sequitur for 2 reasons:\n1. Premise 1 speaks nothing about possibility, but only about opined relativity.\n    - in other words, nothing is posited about whether or not men *can* be machines. P1 simply states that \"if we had these rules, we'd be no better\".\n2. P1 ignores the possibility that men could be machines without such definite rules\n3. P2 is painting \"rules\" as a binary construct. It is making them seem as if they exist, or do not, rather than rightfully placing them on a continuum. P2 implies, \"if we do not have a strict set of rules (which is what machines have), then things without those strict set of rules cannot be a machine.\"\n\n### Occam's Razor\nThe simple explanation is more likely to be true than to be complex\n- this is because complex explanations have by definition more moving parts (think of them as variables in a function). All it takes is one variable to be wrong in either explanation, and the whole theory no longer holds water\n- take 2 explanations that explain the same phenomenon: 1 simple and 1 complex. the first has 3 moving parts (3 variables) and the second has 30. if there was 99% confidence that each variable was trustworthy, then the first explanation would have only a 3% chance of being wrong, while the second would have a 26% chance\n\n### Hanlon's Razor\nthe explanation most likely to be right is the one that contains the least amount of intent behind it\n- you should not attribute to malice that which is more easily explained by stupidity/ignorance/mistakes\n- Hanlon's Razor is a counter to confirmation bias\n\n### The relationship between cognition and disfluency\nWhen things are more arcane and complex to understand (or are just organized poorly, meaning more attention has to be paid in order to progress), comprehension rises. Also, people become more deliberate and analytical with their rational thought. When things are fluent as easy to understand and reason about, we default to our lazy auto-pilot brain which kind of skims by it without registering.\n- ex. Think of how we sing a song we've heard a thousand times— we don't even realize the words we are singing. This is because knowing a song carries with it a high degree of fluency.\n\n### Problem of Induction\n- \"can inductive reasoning lead to knowledge?\"\n- inductive reasoning presents issues, because:\n\t1. you may observe a large sample of something, and still make a false conclusion about it\n\t\t- ex. the existence of black swans\n\t2. you may believe that sequences of events that have \"always\" occurred will continue to occur indefinitely (Uniformity of Nature)\n\t\t- ex. the laws of physics will always hold\n        - ex. the sun will always rise\n\n### The tendency to think linearly\nin a primitive environment, process and result are closely tied\ntherefore our emotional apparatus is designed for linear causality\n- ie. given 2 causally linked variables, more input of one variable will result in more output of the other variable\n- ex. building a bridge— more efforts will result in more work getting done\n- when things are not linear, it is much easier to become demoralized, since we expect a reward for our effort (all black swans are nonlinear)\n\n### Negative Empiricism\na series of corroborative facts is **not** evidence.\n- ex. turkey making inductive rationales as to why life is good and will continue to be so, since he has only observed life up until his unexpected death. before that, everything would falsely indicate that everything would continue to be good\nhowever, we **can** know which statement is wrong, but not necessarily which is correct.\n- ex. if I see a black swan, I can verify not all swans are white.\n- ex. finding a malignant tumor proves the existence of cancer, but not finding one doesnt prove the absense of cancer\ntherefore, we can edge toward the truth by *negative instances*, rather than making verifications\n\nit is misleading to build general truths from observed facts (and our body of knowledge doesnt grow from a series of confirmatory observations (like the Turkey's).\n- therefore, observations are asymmetrical in the sense that some observations can be used to confrim facts, while others cannot\n- this shows that we may have 1000 points of data that provides less value than a single point\n- \"1000 observations cannot prove you right, but 1 observation can prove you wrong\"\n- takeaway: be resistant and sceptical of definitive truths\n- takeaway: when you have a theory about something, start looking for observations that would prove it wrong (this is fighting confirmation bias in a direct way)\n- there is no such thing as corroborative evidence\n\n## Resources\n- https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com\n\n## Related\n- [[self.bias]]","n":0.033}}},{"i":253,"$":{"0":{"v":"Reification","n":1},"1":{"v":"\na.k.a *Fallacy of Misplaced Concreteness*\n\nit is a common bias to take the abstraction put out before you and misinterpret what is factual and what is not. in other words, the lines between purpose of the model and its limitations are blurred.\n- when looking at a map, we may assume that if a territory matches the map in a couple of respects, then it matches the map in all respects.

Otherwise, we would have felt the shock of puzzlement and perplexity that comes from getting in over our depth.\n\n### Active recall vs Passive study\nactive recall testing is far more effective at building strong memories than passive study.\n- *Active recall* testing means being asked a question and trying to remember the answer.\n    - the same type of thing is happening when we learn something new and are immediately asked to explain it to others. Prior to doing this, we likely have a higher degree of confidence in our understanding than afterward, when we try to explain it to someone else. At this point, the holes in our knowledge become apparent. Holes in an understanding of something is important, because knowledge by itself just floats around, and without something to attach it to, is simply forgotten. On the other hand, once we identify these holes and then proceed to fill them in, the knowledge becomes sticky since it becomes part of a larger mesh of understanding.\n- contrast with *passive study*, where we read, watch, or listen to something without pausing to consider if we know the answer\n\n### Learning with Mnemonics\nAll semantic learning (think: internalized knowledge) is mnemonic in nature as the semantic framework can make the best kind of a mnemonic framework.\n\nmnemonic \"link words/concepts\" should be overly impactful. Think of how George Carlin said \"every good joke needs one thing that is *way* out of proportion. The link word needs to be that thing so that it stands out in your memory when you are learning that language.\n- mnemonics need to have strong association (read: *glue*), and at the very least, visual association. Even better if sound, smell and feel can be associated as well. The stonger the association, the quicker the target word can be retrieved from memory\n- also, mnemonics that are more sensational will stick in the memory stronger. This is why the details of dirty jokes tend to be remembered.\n\nThe more meaningful something is, the more likely it is to stick in your brain\n\nExemplify the general truth that has been enunciated by the teacher by referring to a particular instance of it. To imagine a possible case is often as good as citing an actual one. If you cannot, you do not know what is being said.\n\nyour investment of time and effort should be proportional to the long term benefit that you stand to gain by focusing your attention there.\n- ex. if a smart person you know sends you a 10 minute article that says helped shape who he is, you should realistically give the article a close and effortful read, since there is a higher percent chance that this material will impact you in a similar way.\n\nWhen learning a new concept that is a bit arcane to you, see if you can leverage examples of things that you already understand, so that you can leverage existing knowledge.\n- (When using this technique, the closer related the 2 things are, the more likely it will be a better analogy)\n- ex. In learning how [[DNS|dns]] works, we learn that it is a hierarchical system. That seems a bit abstract to me, and I don't really understand the implication. One approach to gain a deeper understanding here, is it ask myself \"what other kind of hierarchical systems can I think of?\". What about a file system on UNIX? Hierarchy in that context makes me think of levels. It makes me realize that there are multiple distinct stages that you can traverse, with the ability to behave differently at each level (ie. having different files/foler combination at each level). In the DNS context, I can understand the hierarchical description better. If it were a filesystem, the root directory would contain top-level domains (directories). Within each TLD, there would be domain names (also directory), and within domain names, there would be sub-domain names. Since you are leveraging knowledge that already existed in order to gain new knowledge, this is *syntopic learning*.\n\nIf you find yourself completely lost on a concept, ask yourself: “Do I not understand this because it is complex, or do I not understand this because I don’t understand the things that surround it?”\n\n## Focused vs Diffusive Thinking (Learning modes)\nThere are 2 different ways of thinking about a problem: Focused and Diffuse\n- We can only be in one mode of thinking at a time\n\n### Focused mode\n- Using the familiar focused mode, we can leverage the neural pathways that have already been built to recall and learn new information. This is the most familiar method\n- anal. In a game of pinball, this mode would involve a lot more pins. This poses no problem if we are learning (or recalling) something in an area that we are familiar with. However, it causes problems when we want to learn something new (ie. something that takes place in the bottom left)\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-03-26-13-11-03.png)\n\n### Diffuse mode\n- Using the diffuse mode, thoughts can go much further before their progress is impeded.\n- diffuse learning happens in the background when we are not even thinking about the topic at hand\n- of course, to be able to think diffusively we need to first think about the topic in a focused way\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-03-26-13-11-20.png)\n- ex. Salvator Dali (a painter) used to hold a key in his hand as he drifted off to sleep so that he'd awake just before sleeping. In that state of somnolense, his mind was open to diffuse thinking, so by awaking immediately before sleeping, he was able to get access to these pathways created while drifting off to sleep.\n\nAll learning is dependent on feedback.\n- The faster the feedback, the faster you can learn.\n- Thus, in many domains, the individual, team, or organization with the fastest feedback cycle is the one that wins.\n\n* * *\nif we learn before napping/sleeping, we have an increased chance of dreaming about it.\n- Sleeping consolidates memories into easier to grasp chunks of knowledge\n\n* * *\n\nThere is danger in blindly trusting past experience for dealing with the future. \"We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom in it, and stop there; lest we be like the cat that sits down on the hot stove lid. Yes, she will never sit down on a hot lid again, but also he will never sit down on a cold one either\"\n\n### Syntopical learning\n- ex. \"What applies in biological growth applies in economic growth\"\n- ex. \"What applies in computer networks applies in social networks\"\n\n### Elements of deliberate learning\nAnders Ericsson, the man who originated the 10,000 rule would argue that deliberate practice is what mattery; the actual amount of hours more or less being just an estimate.\n\nAccording to Ericsson, there are 4 Elements of deliberate practice:\n1. Hyper-intentionality about a specific weakness or trying to achieve a particular goal.\n2. Practice with complete attention (acting alone is better)\n3. Get feedback about what you have done, get clarity on new questions that have arisen.\n4. Repetition of the cycle\n\n* * *\n\n### Focusing on the zone of Peripheral Competency\nYou have a zone of things you know, a zone of things you don’t know, and a zone of things that are in the periphery of your knowledge. It’s this 3rd zone you need to focus your attention on when you are expanding your knowledge in a particular field\n\n### Learning loop\n1. You have an action\n2. You reflect on it\n3. You build an abstraction to try and understand it in less \"implementation-level\" terms\n\n## Thoughts\n- Regarding time spent practicing to learn a new skill, does it have an effect if you practice sporadically throughout the day vs. maybe keeping it to 1-2 practice sessions?\n\n## Philosophical\nIn school, you’re given the lesson first. On the street, you’re given the mistake first and then it’s up to you to find the lesson.\n\na mistake is simply a lesson with emotions attached to it.\n\n“Whenever we make a mistake, we become upset. An upset is our brain's way of telling us that we need to learn something. It is a tap on our shoulder saying, ‘Pay attention. You have something important to learn. If you lie, blame, justify, or deny the upset, you waste the upset and will waste a precious gem of wisdom.’”\n\nEnlightenment is achieved only when, in addition to knowing what an author says, you know what he means and why he says it.\n\nDeep understanding requires that one uses one’s senses and imagination. One must observe, and remember, and construct imaginatively what cannot be observed.\n\n# UE Resources\n- [2 rules of knowledge formulation](https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/articles/20rules)\n","n":0.026}}},{"i":261,"$":{"0":{"v":"Law","n":1}}},{"i":262,"$":{"0":{"v":"Trust","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nThe main difference between a Will and a Trust is that the trust will let you transfer assets to beneficiaries when you’re still alive, while a will transfers your assets when you die.\n\n### Purpose\nA trust allows you to separate the control and management of an asset from its ownership.\n\nTrusts are used to manage estate taxes, shelter assets from creditors and pass on wealth to future generations.\n- one of the most common uses of a trust is to allow for family income and capital gain splitting. \n\nThe way that the trust does this is by splitting income amongst lower-income earning family members by way of paying dividends out of a private corporation.\n- spec: is this just for a family trust?\n\na trust is formed when a settlor contributes property to the trust for the person he intends to benefit\n\nThe usefulness of a trust is based on the fact that a `trustee` can hold property on behalf a single beneficiary, or a group of `beneficiaries`, for their benefit while maintaining control over the property.\n- This can be useful from a tax perspective, as it allows income of the trust to be shared with `beneficiaries` who may be taxed at a lower rate than the trust while not giving up control over the property.\n\n### Parties\nThere are 3 parties to a trust:\n- a `grantor`/`settlor` - the person who makes the trust and transfers their assets into it. They also set out instructions on how the assets are to be used or managed and who will benefit from the assets\n- a `trustee` - the person who manages the assets in the trust on behalf of the `beneficiaries`.

The trust's income should be taxed in the hands on low-income family members (known as *income allocation*).\n- If certain conditions are met, trust income can be allocated to the beneficiaries and taxed in their hands rather than the trust. Most of the tax benefits associated with an inter-vivos trust are achieved in this manner.\n\n### Purpose\nThe transfer of assets to beneficiaries is better from a tax point of view if the recipient pays less tax than you would on any income earned on the asset.\n\nThis is what the trust does for us. The settlor transfers ownership of their assets to the trust, while retaining control of them.\n\n#### Income or capital gains-splitting\nIncome splitting occurs when trust income is taxed in the hands of the beneficiaries of the trust.\n- This income doesn't have to be given directly to the beneficiary. For instance, an \"in trust\" account can be set up for a minor. The money entering the account is then taxed in the hands of the child (Remember however that the money does belong to the child and will have to be turned over once the child reaches the age of majority).\n- There are certain payments that can be made for the benefit of the beneficiary that are treated as income to the beneficiary.\n    - The trust may pay for a beneficiaries tuition fees and medical expenses, and the payment amount will be taxed in the hands of the minor.\n\nThis may come in handy in a situation where the settlor may have a large amount of income while other family members are not fully utilizing personal tax credits and low marginal tax rates.\n- Tax savings could arise if you could transfer beneficial ownership of your income producing assets to a trust. If the income in the tax is taxed under the tax bracket of the individual family members, they'll pay less tax.\n\nThe potential benefits from income splitting were reduced for some after 1999 with the introduction of the kiddie tax.\n- Under these rules, the child will pay tax on the split income at top rates and the child can't claim personal credits to reduce the tax.\n- Despite the kiddie tax rules, you can still split interest income received from arm's length parties and certain other forms of income with a minor. In addition, the kiddie tax does not apply to spouses/common-law partners and adult children\n\nFor capital gains, the benefits are similar, except that if the property sold is qualified farm or fishing property or shares of a qualified small business corporation, the use of a trust may allow better access to the capital gains exemption of each family member that is a beneficiary of the trust\n\n#### Estate freeze\nImagine you own shares in a company that is carrying on business. You expect the value of the corporation to increase rapidly in the future. As the value of the shares increase, the amount of tax payable upon your death increases too, due to fair market value of capital gains.\n\nUnder an estate freeze, you exchange beneficial ownership of your common shares for preferred shares with a fixed value.\n- New common shares will be issued and held by a trust for your children. Future gains will accrue to them through the trust.\n- This plan effectively freezes the capital gain that will arise on your death based on today's value while allowing you or your trustees to retain control over the common shares.\n    - It can also enhance the ability of a family to access the capital gains exemption.\n\n### Income Attribution Rules\nThe income paid or payable to the beneficiaries must not be subject to the income attribution rules. Whether or not these rules apply depends on how the trust was set up.\n- The attribution rules can potentially apply whenever you gift property or make a loan at little or no interest to a family member, including loans and gifts made through the use of a trust. \n\nMost important rules are:\n- If you make a loan at an interest rate lower than prescribed by the government OR gift property to a trust for the benefit of your spouse, any income or capital gains from the transferred property allocated to the spouse will be taxed in your hands.\n- If you make a loan or gift property to a minor child or a trust for a minor child, income from the funds allocated to the child will be taxed in your hands. In this case, a minor child includes a son, daughter, niece or nephew under 18 or some other minor with whom you do not deal at arms length. Note, however that capital gains arising from the property will be taxed in the hands of the child.\n- If you gift property to a trust and you are a trust beneficiary, all income and capital gains of the trust (as well as income losses and capital losses) will be taxed in your hands. This rule will also apply if you gift property to a trust and you can later control who will receive trust property or you can control when the property is disposed of. Consequently, you should never transfer income-producing property to a trust and be a controlling trustee or beneficiary, if income splitting is desired.  Trusts subject to these rules are often called reversionary trusts\n- If you make a loan to a trust benefiting an adult child or other adult relative, income from the funds may be attributed to you, if the purpose of the loan was to reduce taxes.  Capital gains, however, will not be attributed to you.\n- If you make a low interest (or interest-free) loan or transfer property to a corporation, and a trust for other family members is a shareholder, then you could be deemed to earn interest on the loan or transfer\n    - this rule doesn't apply if your corporation is a Small Business Corporation.\n\nThe attribution rules should not be a concern if the rules of thumb are followed:\n- Select your settlor and settlement property carefully\n    - A gift must be made by a settlor to create a trust. The gift should be easily segregated and should not produce income, such as a gold coin.  The concern is that attribution can arise if the gift becomes intermingled with the income-producing property\n- Borrow funds from a third party to purchase income-producing property.\n    - If the trust borrows money from a third party to purchase income-producing assets such as shares of your small business corporation, attribution can be avoided. In this case, you didn't make a loan to the trust.\n- Make sure the income producing property isn't from you\n    - Even if a loan is obtained from a third party, attribution can still apply if the asset is purchased from you.\n    - In the case of a family-owned corporation, this is easily accomplished by having the trust purchase new shares directly from the corporation, rather than purchasing existing shares from you. The shares must be acquired at fair market value.\n- Hold growth assets in a trust for minors\n    - If the trust invests in assets which will produce capital gains, such as Canadian equity mutual funds, there will be no income to attribute.\n\n* * *\n\nIntervivos includes many [subcategories](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/trust-administrators/types-trusts.html#intervivos), such as:\n- employee benefit plan\n- personal trust\n- mutual funds\n- NPO\n- RESP\n- RRSP\n- TFSA \n","n":0.028}}},{"i":265,"$":{"0":{"v":"Personal","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nA personal trust is one where the beneficiaries do not pay for their interest in the trust\n- ie. they receive their interest in the trust's assets as a gift\n\n### Discretionary Trust\nA trust in which the distributions of assets will be left to the discretion of the trustee.\n\nIt is possible for a trust to be both discretionary and non-discretionary.

For instance, changing the behavior of a large group of people wouldn't be so much persuasion as it is influence, since we may not be interacting directly with this group.\n\nwhenever you want to change something in the world, you must first identify 1. the things that would support your change coming to fruition and 2. the things that would impede your change coming to fruition, and either augmenting #1 or reducing #2.\n- ex. you want to get women to start smoking, recognize the forces at play 1) women are more and more desiring to be slim; 2) smoking is seen as a man's activity.\n\n## 7 Principles (Robert Cialdini)\nThe 7 principles are shortcuts that we as humans take to facilitate our being persuaded about something. Since we cannot realistically devote brain power toward rationalizing everything, we need shortcuts to arrive at these conclusions.\n- The concept of \"influencing someone\" is to point to those principles where they naturally exist. There is no deception involved, and in fact we are simply informing them into assent by simply raising the profile of that principle. Manipulation, on the other hand, involves the counterfeiting of those principles in order to arrive at assent.\n\n1. Social proof\n2. Reciprocity\n3. Authority\n4. Liking\n5. Commitment & Consistency\n6. Scarcity\n7. Unity\n\n### Social Proof (Popularity)\nThe more uncertain we are the more weight we will put into what we consider to be popular opinion.\n- naturally, \"popular opinion\" is from the perspective of the subject to be influenced. They will put more weight into groups they agree with.\n\n### Reciprocity\nConsider that a normal way of doing business: You give me money and I’ll give you this good in exchange. Reciprocity on the other hand, is about doing something for the customer first, in anticipations of receiving reciprocity later. This is a powerful tool that spans all cultures; virtually all humans do this.\n\nex. Consider the example of when we are doing a blood drive, and we go up to the person and we ask, \"will you be a long-term blood donor for us, and donate blood every month for the next five years?\". In response, they say they can’t do that, that it is too much of an obligation for them. In response we say \"OK, well then can you do one donation tomorrow when one of our volunteers is in your neighborhood?\". People respond positively 55% of the time if they were asked in this manner, as opposed to 33% if they were never asked to be a long-term blood donor at all.\n- The reciprocity here is that the resident of the house has experienced the blood drive solicitor give up a concession, so they felt the urge to give a concession as well.\n\t- Also consider that it’s not just the reciprocity, but is the magnitude of the reciprocity. The concession seems so much smaller in comparison to the original request, so it's considered to be \"the least that one could do\".\n\nIf you give someone something that is higher in their goal hierarchy, then they will reciprocate more to you. \n- ex. Consider the example at McDonald’s, where in one case, the restaurant gave keychains to people who would come to the restaurant. In the other case, the restaurant gave a milkshake to those who came in to the restaurant. In the second case, th amount of the expenditure was double that of the first.\n\n* * *\n\nWhen trying to convince someone who has an opinion that is different than yours, it is tempting to ask \"why\" questions.

Here, you were asking them to provide you with a list of things that confirms why they believe what they believe.

Contrast that with species of apes, some of which have it baked into their DNA that they have an alpha male who will lead them. They will never develop democracy, because they lack ability to tell fictions about how things ought to be. A Human’s unique characteristic here is that they can tell stories about how things should be, and can rally other people behind this story. In essence, all of this takes place in the collective minds of many different people. A common myth allows people to unite and initiate change which drives hyper speed “evolution”. \n- ex. consider the case of corporations.

However we differ from the people in our home town is how we define ourself. That’s where we shape our self-identity, growing up. Those are our defining traits.

Carrying on, to get MA of `Year4` we calculate the averages from `Year2` to `Year6`. This is how we derive the trend line.\n\n- Typical periods: 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200, but these really are arbitrary.\n- Moving averages filter out the “noise” from random short-term price fluctuations.\n- From a technical perspective, the MA is used to:\n\t1. identify trends\n\t\t- if price > MA, upward trend\n\t\t- if price < MA, downward trend\n\t2. identify support (floor) and resistance (ceiling) levels\n\t\t- More technical traders set stop losses at Moving Average-current price differentials (ie. they find the stop-loss point by subtracting the MA from the current price).

In other words, you wouldn't be as willing to \"weather the storm\"\n\t\t\t- This means that generally, volatility reduces the relevance of the MA. You pick a longer period to offset the amount that you \"care\" about volatility (remember: volatility only can exist in the context of a time-period, since a short-term trader sees a 5% daily swing as much more volatile a movement than an investor would view it). \n- Longer MAs by nature have longer lag times, which impacts when we will consider something to be uptrend of downtrend. \n\t- This makes sense, because \"trend\" only makes sense in the context of a time period.

(how much are you willing to lose to offset the upside of that investment?) \n\t- ex. I need a 2x upside, meaning I will take an investment that has equal upsides of success/failure if the upside is 40% and the downside is 20%. If I buy a stock at $100, then I should set stop-loss at $80.\n\t\t- In reality, I might be inclined to go with a lower stop-loss, if I expect there to potentially be some short term losses, but I am confident of a long-term return (ex. `TSLA`)\n- the more risky an investor you are (in terms of expected return on the type of stocks you choose), the more loss you should be willing to risk, and the lower your stop loss.\n\t- Imagine when a stock like `WIX` loses 15% in a day. It's not that surprising, and can be expected with the natural volatility of the tech market. This doesn't necessarily indicate anything wrong with the company's long term business model, and you should seriously consider weathering the storm and resisting the urge to sell. This is why a 15% stop loss might be a bad idea. Ask yourself \"at what point would this occur infrequently enough where an X% loss would be a bad thing?\". In other words, what is beyond the realm of \"everything's ok\"?\n\t- If this is your philosophy, you can set stop losses *just below* longer-term moving averages (just below, because technical traders set their stop-losses at moving averages. You probably don't want to sell at this exact point)\n\t\t- The amount below depends on how much risk you are willing to accept on the stock\n- Stop-loss orders don't work well for large blocks of stock as you may lose more in the long run.\n- Stop-Losses guarantee execution, but not price (slippage). \n\t- In fact, most sell-stop orders are filled at a price below the strike price. The faster the stock is dropping, the further below your strike price you will ultimately sell at.\n- When the stock price reaches the stop-loss price, the order will become a market order, (meaning the stock will be sold at best price available)\n\n## Stop-Limit\n- Whereas a regular Stop Loss becomes a `SELL @ Market` order, a Stop Limit will become a `SELL @ Limit` order\n\t- This means that not only do we specify the stop price, but we also specify the limit price.\n- Normal stop loss says: \"when it reaches this price, just sell it\"\n- Stop-Limit says: \"when it reaches *this* price (stop price), I want you to start marketing it around and only sell it when it reaches *this* price (limit price)\"\n- Limit orders by definition have no guarantee that they will execute, so likewise, even if the stop-loss trigger was hit, the stock will not necessarily be sold. \n- Stop-Limit is the proverbial \"person who is eager to sell, but only at his price\" (he wants to sell, but not bad enough that the ensuing \"storm\" isn't worth weathering)\n\n### Uses\n- These allow you to be a bit more conservative when it comes to bigger longer term shifts. For instance, COVID caused massive chunks of the market to be sold-off unjustifiably. Imagine instead of using stop-losses, you just closely watch your stocks with a keen analytical eye every day. If you saw COVID happening, you might want to hold off on selling your positions. Humans are prone to overreacting, and it is better to be cautious about what is perceived to be happening (ie. is the panic truly tantamount to the ultimate outcome of COVID?\n\t- If we set Stop-Limit orders, then we will better protect ourselves from these situations, \n\t- At this point, you would want to re-evaluate appropriate levels of new stop losses\n- I might set a stop-limit when I think there is somewhat of a substantial dip in the stock price impending, but it's worth keeping long-term. In effect, I'll own the stock either way, but maybe I hold onto it, or maybe I sell it now, and buy it back after a period of time when I think it's on the upswing again\n\t- Together with buying a stop loss and stop-limit order, you might decide to execute an open buy order, to execute at a certain price when the stock is on its way up again.\n\t\t- This should only be done if you think the stock is a good long-term investment. A major market event like Covid will likely only cause a temporary dip in the market. Therefore, only execute this strategy in an effort for quick discounts on the way back up\n\t\t- ex. have stop loss as $90, with the current being at $100. When the price drops to $90 (10% loss), we execute the SELL order, and cash out. I also have an open buy order that will only exectute at $70. The idea is that I cashed out at $90, so I am hoping for as much market drop as possible at this point. At this point, you need to put a fundamental market analysis hat on, and ask if the current market trends will continue. This is when you have to analyse if Covid will appear to get worse, driving market sentiment down. This is obviously very hard to predict, but the principle is to take a guess at how far down the price will drop. You want to be able to get your buy order executed on the way back up— assuming the stock drops down far enough for it to get fulfilled. \n\n## Trailing Stop-loss\n- The stop loss point is defined as a percentage drop in the daily-high of a stock. Unlike a regular stop loss, it keeps moving each day.\n\t- The trailing stop value will rise, but it will never lower. The value that this adds is to lock in ever-increasing gains \n- This type of stop-loss is probably more of a trader tool than an investing tool \n- if you are more intolerant of price fluctuation, then you might set a stop loss at 5%, meaning a SELL will be triggered if it drops that amount.\n- A good strategy may be to use both regular stops and trailing stops.\n\t- ex. set a stop at 5%, and a trailing stop at 10%. This means that you'll never lose more than 5% of your investment, and as the stock rises, you become more tolerant of price drops (accepting up to 10%). However, you'll never lose more than 5%. \n\t- \"The trailing stop/stop-loss combo eliminates the emotional component from trading, letting you rationally make measured decisions based on statistical information.\"\n- The trail value that you decide on should accommodate \"normal\" price fluctuations\n\t- ex. if a stock routinely moves 5% in any given day, it makes no sense to set the trailing stop at 5%\n- It might make sense to tighten the trailing stop level (ex. 5% -> 4%) as the stock price rises, if we are more concerned about locking in profits as opposed to taking advantage of further growth in the stock\n","n":0.029}}},{"i":303,"$":{"0":{"v":"Limit","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Limit\n- set the cap at where a stock can be bought/sold at\n\n## Buy Limit\n- set an upper limit on what you will pay for the stock\n\t- \"I will pay no more than *$X/share*\"\n\n## Sell Limit\n- set a lower limit on what you will sell the stock at.\n\t- \"I want at least *$X/share*\"\n","n":0.137}}},{"i":304,"$":{"0":{"v":"Options","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Overview\nOptions derive their value from the fact that no one knows where the stock price is going to be in X amount of days. All we know is that it won’t be where it currently is. This is of the option however the resulting prices of these options is considered the aggregate beliefs on where a stock will be in any amount of given time\n\nAn option is a [[finance.securities.derivative]] because its price is intrinsically linked to the price of something else\n\noptions premiums are a function of two main ingredients:\n1. value of the option (profit gained by executing option)\n2. time value\n\n↑option value as ↑interest rate\n- And when you sell an option, profit is capped at the price of the premium, but the downside potential is unlimited.\n\nWith options, a strategy can be employed to profit off literally any type of market condition (bear, bull, sideways)\n\nAs an option buyer, your objective should be to purchase options with the longest possible expiration, in order to give your trade time to work out\n- And when you are writing options, go for the shortest possible expiration in order to limit your liability.\n\nThe main draw of options is one of leverage\n- ex. given a simple situation where an investor has $1000 to burn and is bullish on a stock; a simple 14% upward movement in the price of a stock could result in a CALL return of 150% (Just to demonstrate how far apart these percentages are)\n\t- It's true that buying a CALL and buying a stock both have capped downsides, but if in both situations we are spending $1000, the option route is more like \"the downside is 100%\", whereas just buying a stock, it's unlikely the stock goes to 0.\n\t- In reality, since you don't have to own an option until expiry, you can sell before losing all your money\n\nTypically, an options contract loses approximately one-third of its time value during the first half of its life.\n- Time value decreases at an accelerating pace and eventually reaches zero as the option's expiration date draws near.\nA common mistake option investors make is allowing a profitable trade to sit long enough that theta reduces the profits substantially.\n- For example, a trader may buy an option for $1, and see it increase to $5. Of the $5 premium, only $4 is intrinsic value. If the stock price doesn't move any further, the premium of the option will slowly degrade to $4 at expiry\n\n# Terminology\n### Open Interest (OI)\nGives a sense of the liquidity of an option\n- is not simply a count of all the available buy and sell contracts\n- instead, intended to provide a more accurate picture of trading activity surrounding options, and the ∆money flow in and out of options\n\nWhen a buyer and seller make a contract, the contract is considered \"open\" and, will only close upon execution, expiration, or manual closing out of the option.\n- If there were low open interest, it would be more difficult to get option orders filled at a good price\n- one must also examine whether the open interest is in calls or puts and whether the contracts are being bought or sold.\n- \"Volume\" refers to the number of contracts traded in a given period, and is distinct from OI\n\n#### Interpretations\n- ↑Prices & ↑Trend & ↑OI - can mean that new money is coming into the market (reflecting new positions; a bullish sign)\n- ↑OI ↓StrikePrice - a sign of a downward trend of the underlying stock.\n\t- might suggest that new money is coming into the market on the short side\n- ↓Prices & ↓Trend & ↑OI - This scenario is consistent with a continuing downtrend and is bearish.\n- ↓Prices & ↓Trend & ↓OI - could indicate that holders are being forced to liquidate their positions (bearish).\n\t- could mean that a selling climax could be on the near-term horizon.\n- ↑OI & ↓Prices (sharply decreasing) - could be a bearish signal if holders who bought near the top are now losing money;\n\t- this also could potentially cause an environment of panic selling.\n\n### Implied Volatility (IV)\n- volatility increases the premium of an option.\n\t- This makes sense, since options have limits (floors/ceilings). a CALL holder is not going to care if he is on the wrong end of high volatility any more than if he is at the wrong end of low volatility (since he only loses the premium). However, if he is on the right side of the volatility, then high/low matters, since there is no limit on the upside.\n\t- This is why options become expensive before earnings reports\n- as people gain interest and expecatations for an option, the implied volatility rises\n\t- therefore, volatility is directly influenced by supply and demand\n- the longer the remaining time period, the more IV will matter\n\t- Options with strike prices that are near the money are most sensitive to implied volatility changes, while options that are further in the money or out of the money will be less sensitive to implied volatility changes\n- IV is not the same as historical volatility\n- Implied volatility usually increases in bearish markets and decreases when the market is bullish\n\n### Intrinsic value\n- the difference between the stock price, and the strike price\n\t- in other words, it's what you would get when factoring in the price you can excercise at, and the price of the option itself\n\t- therefore, intrinsic value=0 unless the stock price moves beyond the strike price\n- to calculate how much of an option's premium is due to intrinsic value, an investor would subtract the strike price from the current stock price.\n\t- if the option premium is primarily made up intrinsic value, the option's value and profitability are more dependent on movements in the underlying stock price.\n- time value is the portion of the premium above the intrinsic value that an option buyer pays for the privilege of owning the contract for a certain period.\n\t- therefore, time value is often referred to as extrinsic value.\n\n### Delta\n- a measure of an option's sensitivity to the underlying stock\n\t- ex. Delta=0.6 means a $1 increase in the stock price will result in a $0.60 increase in the option price\n- The delta for puts is represented as a negative number, which demonstrates the inverse relationship of the put compared to the stock movement.\n\t- ex. A put with a delta of -0.4 should increase by 40 cents in value if the stock drops $1 per share.\n- An in-the-money option has higher delta\n\n### Buy to open\n- the act a open a new option\n- if you were bullish on a stock, you would buy to open a call\n- if you were bearing on a stock, you would buy to open a put\n\n### Sell to close\n- the act a holder takes to exit his position in the option\n- if you were no longer bullish on a stock, you would sell to close a call\n- if you were no longer bearish on a stock, you would sell to close a put\n\n# Being a Writer (seller of options)\n- writers are obligated to buy/sell if the option expires in the money\n- Your odds of profit are higher (than if you were a buyer), even though the risk is technically unlimited\n\n# Being a Holder (buyer of options)\n- When you buy an option, loss is capped at the price of the premium, but the upside potential is unlimited.\noption price decays over time\n\"time value of money always settles at zero\"\nwhen buying a call, you should always ask, how will this option overcome the decay inherent in aging options?\n\n# Call\nthe right to buy stock at a given price\n- As ↑StockPrice, ↑OptionPrice\n\t- Though as time goes on, the stock price must rise enough to offset time decay\n- ↑premium, as:\n\t1. stock price rises more and more above strike price\n\t2. time to expiration is longer\n\t3. volatility is higher\n- The more volatile a stock, the more valuable the call option, since losses are already minimized and gains have no limit.\n- Think of a call option as a down-payment for a future purchase. You could also see it as a deposit, in the sense that you can walk away from it and just be limited to losing your deposit.\n\t- ex. A potential homeowner sees a new development going up. That person may want the right to purchase a home in the future, but will only want to exercise that right once certain developments around the area are built.\n\t\t- In the real estate world, this would be known as a deposit (`premium` in options). In the stock world it is a `call`\n\n## Buying\n- Buying call options are total-loss investments, because unless the strike price is reached, the loss will be 100%\n- Can be a strategy for hedging a short position\n\n## Selling\n- Selling a naked (ie. uncovered) call gives you a potential short position in the underlying stock.\n\n# Put\nthe right to sell the stock at a given price\n- ↑premium, as:\n\t1. stock price falls more and more below strike price\n\t2. time to expiration is longer\n\t3. volatility is higher\n\n## Buying\n- Gives you a potential (and less risky) short position in the underlying stock.\n- Can be a strategy for hedging a long position\n\n## Selling\n- Selling a naked, or unmarried, put gives you a potential long position in the underlying stock\n- if slightly bullish, you can write near-term puts to capture premium income\n\n# Relationships\n- The more likely something is to occur, the more expensive an option would be that profits from that event\n\t- ex. as a stock price rises further, the more expensive that CALL will cost.\n- The less time there is until expiry, the less value an option will have\n\t- This is because as we get closer and closer to expiry, the probability that the stock will move drastically in price get smaller and smaller (ie. it is a *wasting asset*)\n\t- ex. if you bought a 1-month option that is out-of-the-money and the stock is stagnant, the option devalues each passing day, because the odds that it eventually becomes in-the-money decreases with each passing day.\n\t- This shows that you can think of an option in terms of \"as long as this event (strike price) occurs within my time period, I'm good\"\n\t- If the stock is worth exactly the same the next day, the option will still be worse less, because of time decay.\n- volatility of the stock increases price of an option, since volatility increases the odds of a certain outcome\n\n# Strategies\n- use options to hedge against a declining market to limit downside losses\n\t- think of a put option as an insurance policy. If you wanted something akin to insurance on a stock that you bought, you could buy a PUT option\n\t- ex. I buy a stock at $100, and am unwilling to lose more than 10%. I buy a PUT with strike price of $90, allowing me sell that stock at $90 anytime within the next 2 years. Now if in 6 months the market drops 20%, I have effectively gained a 10% return, as I can sell a stock with a prevailing price of $80 at $90\n\t\t- a short seller would buy CALL options to limit their exposure\n- can be used for speculative purposes such as wagering on the direction of a stock.\n\t- buying a call option on the stock\n\t- buying a call option instead of just buying the stock may be attractive, since options provide leverage\n\n### Spread\n- buying more than 1 contract at different strike prices\n\t- ie. buying an option(s) to sell another option(s)\n\t- all options should have same expiry\n- spreading will offset the premium paid\n\t- ie. the premium *earned* from selling an option will offset the premium *paid*\n- potential profit/loss are capped\n- can be employed to capitalize on any price movement\n- like regular options, you can be a buyer or seller of a spread strategy\n\n#### Bull Call Spread\n- buy 1+ call at one strike price, while simultaneously selling same number of calls at higher strike price\n- often used when you are bullish on the underlying stock, and expect a moderate rise in its price.\n\t- If you are expecting a large gain, then you'd be limiting your upside which would be a bad idea.\n- This strategy limits upside gain, while reducing premium you have to spend\n![](/assets/images/2021-03-30-22-50-46.png)\n\n#### Bear Put Spread\n- buy 1+ PUT at one strike price, while simultaneously selling same number of PUTs at lower strike price.\n- used in opposite way of the bull call spread— you are moderately bearish on the stock, and want to limit your gain/loss\n![](/assets/images/2021-03-30-22-51-03.png)\n\n### Protective Put\n- buy a put with a strike price below the current price, and simultaneously own the stock.\n- purpose is to hedge (ie. insure) a long-term investment (ie. create a floor of loss)\n- if ↓investment, put can be exercized to recover some of the loss\n- Therefore, this strategy is good on a long-term play, where you might be anticipating some loss (think `PRPL` stock)\n- If however the investment is a success, then your profit must factor in the cost of that PUT.\n- The only disadvantage of this strategy is that if the stock does not fall in value, the investor loses the amount of the premium paid for the put option.\n- known as *Married Put* when the coverage from the put is equal to the amount of long stock\n- P&L graph looks similar to a long call’s P&L graph\n![](/assets/images/2021-03-30-22-51-17.png)\n\n### Covered Call\n- buy a stock, while simultanously selling a call\n\t- therefore, a type of **buy-write** transaction\n\t- The investor will sell the same amount of options as shares that he owns, so that when/if the holder of the call comes knocking, the investor will already own the stock that he needs to sell to the holder of the call.\n- the \"cover\" is the stock that investor owns, since they can use it to cover the cost of having to provide the owner of the call with the stock, should they choose to execute the option.\n\t- Whereas if the writer of the call didn't actually own the stock, they would have to go on the open market and buy the stock, then sell it to the holder of the call for the strike price. Since the situation of them exercising the option would occur when the strike price is below the current price, this investor would lose a potentially unlimited amount of money. In a Covered Call situation, since we own the stock, we don't need to worry about this. We just have to be ready to sell our stock for the price that we agree we'd sell it at to them (strike)\n- purpose is to limit both losses and gains, while giving a higher probability of *some* gain.\n- losses are limited at the price of the stock, minus the income earned from the sale of the call.\n- gains are capped at the strike price\n- ideal for an investor who believes the underlying price will not move much over the near-term, while simultaneously believing in the long-term worth of the stock.\n\t- ex. perhaps banking stocks following Covid— since their prices dropped significantly, but the long-term integrity of the banks is not really hindered.\n- alternatively, you might use this strategy when you have a short-term position in the stock and a neutral opinion on its direction\n![](/assets/images/2021-03-30-22-51-33.png)\n\n### Straddle\n- buy a CALL and buy a PUT at same strike price and same expiration date\n- profit happens when the stock price rises/falls *in excess* of both option premiums paid\n\t- ex. if stock is at $100 and we buy a CALL and PUT at strike=$80, and both options cost a total of $10, then we will realize profit when the stock price is either below $70 or above $90\n- an investor will employ this strategy when they are expecting movement out of a specific range, but aren't sure on direction of movement.\n\t- Therefore, there are 2 breakeven points\n\t- In this sense, the aim is the inverse of a **covered call**\n- loss is limited at the price of the premiums\n![](/assets/images/2021-03-30-22-51-46.png)\n\n### Strangle\n- similar to a Straddle, except the CALL and PUT have different strike prices\n- on long strangles, the (out-of-the-money) call's strike price will be higher than the stock price, and the put's strike price will be lower than the stock price\n- riskier than a straddle, since the stock will have to make a bigger movement to make profit\n\t- reflected by the the lower price compared to a straddle\n![](/assets/images/2021-03-30-22-51-56.png)\n\n### Protective Collar\n- buy an out-of-the-money PUT (the floor) and simultaneously write an out-of-the-money CALL (the ceiling) (same expiration)\n- strategy is employed after an investor has experienced substantial gains from a long position and wants to have downside protection.\n- the trade-off is that they may be obligated to sell shares at a higher price, thereby forgoing the possibility for further profits.\n- ex. bought SHOP at $1000, and it rose to $1500. The investor decides he is happy with those gains, so buys a $1600 PUT and sells a $1400 CALL.\n- vs. Stop Loss\n\t- pro\n\t\t- stop loss is triggered when price hits $1500, whereas the collar just becomes in-the-money, so there is no obligation to sell\n\t\t- protects against the risk of slippage\n\t- con: limits upside\n\n# Misc\n- On most U.S. exchanges, a stock option contract is the option to buy or sell 100 shares; that's why you must multiply the contract premium by 100 to get the total amount you’ll have to spend to buy the call.\n- The majority of the time, holders choose to take their profits by trading out (closing out) their position. This means that option holders sell their options in the market, and writers buy their positions back to close. Only about 10% of options are exercised, 60% are traded (closed) out, and 30% expire worthlessly.\n","n":0.019}}},{"i":305,"$":{"0":{"v":"Restricted Stock Unit","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\nA Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) is a form of stock based compensation that:\n- will vest at some point in the future\n- will have some value upon vesting (unlike stock options)\n- is based on the value of the company's stock\n- will vest at some point in the future, likely based on time passed or perhaps the achievement of a goal.

Synthetics are cheaper and easier to create than traditional CDOs when the mortgage market dries up.\n\nSynthetic CDOs are controversial because of their role in the subprime mortgage crisis.

In other words, some technical tools can inform fundamental analysis.\n\n### Taking advice\nOne of the biggest problems with taking advice of other traders/investors is that everyone has a different time horizon to work with, which results in vastly different conclusions on what the market is going to do.  \n\n### Time Horizon\nThe longer the Time Horizon the more aggressive (riskier) portfolio an investor can build.

The interest payments must come from elsewhere in the circulation of money (that money is also derived from bank loans)\n- Therefore in the aggregate, the debtors must repay the principle + interest of a loan from a total money pool that is composed only of principle.\n\n## Banking Origins: The Goldsmith's Tale\n- note: This is not how it really happened, but rather an allegorical history of banking.\n- [source: Money as Debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_as_Debt)\n\nImagine you are a minter from the middle ages: you take gold, and melt it into a standardized coin, which saves people the trouble of having to verify the gold's purity and weigh it. At some point, the minter needs a place to put his gold, so a vault is created to store it. Soon, other people need a place to store their gold, so they arrange to have the minter also take their gold. In exchange, he gives them a claim check, basically saying \"the bearer of this check can redeem it to receive the stated amount of gold\". What has just been created is in some sense money, since vendors in the market can deal with just the claim checks: they never have to actually handle the gold that it represents. Now, the minter is in a position where he can just lend out the claim checks to those looking for a loan. He doesn't need to actually give out the gold, so the depositors are safe from any kind of mishandling of their money. In exchange for keeping their gold with the minter, they were given a small interest payment. Thus the idea of a bank was born. But this is not how banking works in the 21st century.\n\nAt some point, the minter (now more so a banker) realizes that since no one has visibility into his vault, he can give out claim checks as debt for gold that didn't actually exist. The only risk to this was a bank run. The result of this ability to create claim checks and issue credit to borrowers allowed the economy to expand at such a pace that would never have been possible otherwise. Because of this, the practice of printing off claim checks and lending it out was considered legal, but regulated: bankers agreed to limits on the amount of fictional claim checks that could be lent out. Often, the ratio has been 9 to 1 (only 1/9th the value of money in the economy has to be held as gold). This is the fractional reserve system. Note, the modern day fractional reserve system works the same in principle, but with one impactful distinction: The ratio in question is new debt money to existing debt money on deposit in the bank.\n\n### Modern banking\nIn the past, one paper dollar was redeemable for an equivalent amount in silver. Now, $1 is only redeemable for another $1\n\nA bank's reserves consist of 3 parts\n- amount of government issued cash in vault\n- amount of credit it has with central bank\n- amount of existing cash it has on deposit from its customers\n\nWhen a loan customer needs $10,000 to buy a car. Upon approval, the bank opens a new credit account, and acknowledges that it owes the borrower $10,000. This $10,000 is not taken from anywhere, and is created on the spot. The borrower does not take this money out as cash, and instead writes a check to the owner of the car. The owner of the car then takes this cheque to the bank and deposits it. At a 9:1 fractional reserve ratio, the bank is then able to create a new loan of $9,000. Like a russian doll, this can continue along, with the next amount being $8,100. All of this new money has been created entirely from debt. The process only stops when the money is taken out as cash and not deposited at a bank. This is the unpredictable nature of the money creation mechanism.\n","n":0.037}}},{"i":340,"$":{"0":{"v":"Accounts","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nnote: Account is defined here loosely, as a vehicle for money that has assets and liabilities/equity.\n","n":0.25}}},{"i":341,"$":{"0":{"v":"RRSP","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nWhen you draw down on your RRSP (ie. withdraw money from it), you lose the contribution room of the amount removed.\n\nThe max deduction limit is 18% of gross income previous year, up to $27,830\n\nYou don’t have to deduct an RRSP contribution on your tax return in the same year you make the contribution.

A rabbit and a leopard)\n- Start with a rabbit, and draw its parent to the left, and its parents' parent further to the left, and so on. \n\t- each node is surrounded on either side by its child and its parent. It’s easy to identify each of those nodes that surround it as part of the same species, since they all have more or less the same features.\n- continue this process of adding nodes (parents), and over millions of years we will have resulted in something that is quite distinct from a rabbit, even though we could never observe the changes from node to node (just like you cannot observe an hour hand on a clock move, or observe a child grow up)\n- as we continue to go to the left (ie. back in time), we eventually arrive at the hairpin species– the common ancestor between the rabbit and the leopard. \n- now, we start to go forward in time, but this time, toward the modern day leopard. \n\t- along the way we see many forks, some of which lead to species that eventually went extinct, and some further down the line which exist in the modern day\n- Continuing along the path, we eventually arrive at the leopard\n\nThis thought experiment is the answer to the common plaint \"if humans are descended from chimpanzees, why are there still chimpanzees?\".

This meant the most ambitious, aggressive and competitive men were more likely to pass down their genes, making the whole of males overall in this vein. \n\nOn the other hand, women had no problem finding men to impregnate them. However, they also needed a lot more help, since children require lots of care. They needed a man to stay with them for longer periods of time, leaving them more desperate for the man to stay. This resulted in them having to agree to whatever conditions the man stipulated. Over time, these submissive qualities helped women to pass on their genes, making the overall pool of women more submissive. \n\n* * *\n\nEvolution prefers to build on top of itself, rather than start from scratch\n- expl.

And language with which information can be passed on to offspring\n\n### Microevolution\n- Microevolution looks at changes within species over time—changes that may be preludes to speciation, the origin of new species.\n- skeptics are at least to an extent willing to accept microevolution.\n- ex. the evolution of a beak over time to adapt to the environment\n\n### Macroevolution\n- Macroevolution studies how taxonomic groups above the level of species change. Its evidence draws frequently from the fossil record and DNA comparisons to reconstruct how various organisms may be related.\n\n- To arrive at a conclusion does not require direct observation. \n    - hypotheses can still be tested by checking whether they accord with physical evidence and whether they lead to verifiable predictions about future discoveries\n    - ex. evolution implies that between the earliest known ancestors of humans and the appearance of anatomically modern humans, one should find a succession of hominin creatures with features progressively less apelike and more modern, which is indeed what the fossil record shows. But one should not—and does not—find modern human fossils embedded in strata from the Jurassic period (65 million years ago).\n\n# Events\n## Cambrian Explosion\n- 541 MYA (lasting about 20m years)\n- This is the period where all of the phyla (the hierarchical class below\n    kingdom) started appearing on the fossil record.\n    - In other words, different type of animals started appearing.\n- This is the period that more resembles life right now, since before this,\n    there were no sentient beings walking around — only non-sentient plants,\n    bacteria, fungi etc.\n\n# Facts\n- There are between 10-14 million species on the planet, and we've discovered\n    1.2 million.\n- Traits that stick around longer will become stronger over time. The reason\n    they stick around could be because humans are interfering (ex. selecting\n    chickens who lay more eggs), or it may be the more natural reason: The trait\n    is helping them survive. No matter the cause, the result is the same.\n- chimps are more closely related to humans than they are to gorillas\n  - if you and your brothers dna can be linked to each other (due to their overwhelming similarities brought on from the same parent), then similar dna between species should be indicitive of a common ancestor among them \n  - on average, humans have 99.9% the same DNA as another human. Chimps have 88.8% the same DNA as humans overall\n\n# Logic\n## Points\n- Whales have an ancestor that lived on the land, the Indohyus. Mammals tend to\n    live on land. The reason is because mammals adapted to best handle their\n    environment. In their partiular environment, the best way was to breathe in\n    oxygen. \n\t- a 50 million-year-old, dog-sized member of the extinct raoellidae ungulate family — had ears, teeth and bones that resembled whales, not other raoellids.\n    - However, a whale is one of a few mammals that live in the water. How did\n\tthis happen? Less important is the question of why it happened, since\n\tthere are many reasons why a species may adapt and evolve. What is\n\tbetter is to realize that mammals almost exclusively live on the land.\n\tThe fact that there are a few that live in the water raises the question\n\t\"why?\". \n\t- Being able to duck under the water to avoid prey is a survival trait.\n\t    The Indohyus would do this. Logic would suggest that the species\n\t    evolved over time to give rise to whales because there were more\n\t    manageable threats in the water than on land.\n- There are many similarities between every single species on the planet. This\n    implies that there is a common ancestor \n- like humans, other hominids (like apes) can also get Down Syndrome, though it is not observed in any other animal. This implies some kind of genetic similarity between humans and apes.\n- Consider how much variation there has been with dogs. If so much evolutionary change can occur in just a few centuries or even decades, just think about what might be achieved in ten or a hundred million years.\n\n## Questions for them to ponder\n- Do you believe that horses and cows are more similar than horses and reptiles?\n    or birds and reptiles?\n    - If so, what makes them more similar? Are they just designed that way, or\n\tare they derived from the same place? If they are designed, why then do\n\tthey have microscopic similarities between each other, like same\n\tstructure of hooves, same teeth etc.\n    - Does it make sense that the more similar something is, the more likely\n\tthat they are derived from the same place?\n\t- Mammals have lots in common. Babies are stored in the uterus.\n\t    Placentalias (a sub-mammal group; humans are here) have lots in common too. Their babies are stored in the uterus, until the baby is at a late stage of development.\n\t- This logic shows that we have commonalities. How did they occur? Does\n\t    the logic make sense that if they were derived from a common\n\t    ancestor, that each produced species would have commonalities as\n\t    well as differences?\n\t- It might be believed that these groupings exist (mammal, reptile etc.)\n\t    as a convenience to name things that have similarities. What is\n\t    being missed here, is that the reason they have similarities is\n\t    because they are derived from a single source.\n- fossil records for humans go back farthest in Africa (4 million years). Anywhere else in the world, fossils of this age don't exist. This implies that we originated in Africa. As diaspora happened, tribes separated and maintained distance. Over hundreds of thousands of years, humans further adapted to their environment which caused them to look differently (resulting in different races)\n- when you look at the landscape of Christianity what do you see? What do you make of the 100's of denominations? How are they similar? Different? Are there some that are more similar than others, or are they all equally different? Would you almost say that some have more similar DNA? If so, why do you think that is? Can you imagine a world where there was an arbitrary Christian Church, and both of its leaders disagreed on a topic, so they each made their own denomination? Wouldn't that result in a large web of denominations, with varying degrees of similarity?\n\n## Responding to arguments against\n- saying \"if we came from monkeys, why are there still moneys is tantamount to \n    asking, “If children descended from adults, why are there still adults?” \n    - a child becoming an adult is a natural *evolution*, which causes\n\tconfusion.\n\n* * *\n\nEven if some trait didn’t provide an advantage it could still be carried along as long as it’s not harmful. That neutral trait may be shown to be advantageous or even disadvantageous at some point in the future\n\nThe cockroach is about the same organism as it was millions of years ago because its characteristics were adaptive then and now.\n\nHumans have spent 99% of their evolutionary history as hunter gatherers \n- This shows how dominant the environment of those early humans was in shaping our biology. To understand human biology is to understand what it was like to be a human during that period\n- If we compressed the 4 million years of human evolution into a 24 hour clock, agriculture started at 23:55\n\nA high sense of mortality in a single person or their family will offer little to no evolutionary advantage, but a high sense of morality among an entire tribe will in fact offer an advantage over a less moral tribe. \n\nOnce an organism has survived past the age of reproduction, the organism is evolutionarily useless\n\n## Resources to show\n- [list of phylum that make up the animal kingdom, and how they are categorized according to their similarities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylum#Animals)\n\n# UE Resources\n- http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/genetics/human-skin-color-variation \n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship_between_religion_and_science\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene-centered_view_of_evolution\n","n":0.022}}},{"i":346,"$":{"0":{"v":"Etiquette","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nWhen someone asks you to do something that you don't want to do (e.g. give up seat on plane, sign up for PTA), sympathetically say \"I'm sorry, I just can't\".

Because availability of storage is so inelastic, such a scenario can lead to a gnarly game of musical chairs. And that’s exactly what happened on April 20th 2020, a month into the U.S. Covid-19 pandemic lockdown. Demand for oil dropped so precipitously that oil holders suddenly found themselves scrambling for storage depots.

To say that \"inflation is at 5% this year\" is a misnomer. Rather, what this person means to say is that the Consumer Price Index (as defined by the government) has gotten 5% more expensive this year. Not everything in the economy is part of this CPI.\n\nAn analysis of inflation is incomplete until we have assessed how much the absolute increase in price we will be impacted with. \n- ex. if the CPI rose 5% this year, and gasoline specifically rose 33%, you have then ask the question: \"how much do I spend on gas anyway?\". Maybe your overall gas expense rises from $1000/year to $1330/year, which may be considered immaterial.\n\nThe rationale that \"if inflation is 5% this year then our money is worth 5% less\" is a bit misguided, and is based on this oversimplification of an index like the CPI. Inflation rising by 5% only means that your money is worth 5% less *for those goods in the index*, and somewhat disproportionally too.\n- Often, there is great disproportion in price changes of some members of the CPI. For instance, maybe transportation prices rise 9.1%, but housing only rises by 3.9%.\n- ques: is saying \"housing prices rose by 5%\" the same as saying housing market rose by 5%?\n\nIt is the combination of Fiscal Policy and Monetary Policy that the central bank uses to influence inflation.\n\n## Causes\nThere are different schools of thought as to the causes of inflation. Most can be divided into two broad areas: quality theories of inflation and quantity theories of inflation.\n- The quality theory of inflation rests on the expectation of a seller accepting currency to be able to exchange that currency at a later time for goods they desire as a buyer. \n- The quantity theory of inflation rests on the quantity equation of money that relates the money supply, its velocity, and the nominal value of exchanges.\n    - widely accepted as an accurate model of inflation in the long run.\n\nIn the long run, the inflation rate is essentially dependent on the growth rate of the money supply relative to the growth of the economy. On the other hand, in the short and medium term, inflation may be affected by supply and demand pressures in the economy, and influenced by the relative elasticity of wages, prices and interest rates.\n\n### Keynesian View\n#### Demand Pull\ncaused by increases in aggregate demand due to increased private and government spending\nThis occurs when the demand for certain goods/services is greater than the economy's ability to meet those demands.\n- ex. There were virtually no public concerts in 2020 due to Covid, increasing demand for concerts when they reopened again in 2021.\n\n#### Cost Push\ncaused by a drop in aggregate supply (potential output)\nThis occurs when the cost of wages and materials goes up.\n- ex. the cost of mobile phone circuitry rises, pushing the price of iPhones up\n- ex. when the cost of lumber rises, there is a commensurate rise in housing prices.\n\n#### Changes in Money Supply\nThe central bank can issue bonds (ie. increase the money in circulation, causing inflation), or buy back bonds\n- If the money supply increases faster than the rate of production, this could result in demand-pull inflation (since there will be too many dollars chasing too few products).\n\n#### Currency Devaluation\nThe devaluation of a currency makes a country's exports less expensive, encouraging foreign nations to buy more of the devalued goods.\n- Devaluation also makes foreign products for the devaluing country more expensive which encourages citizens of the devaluing country to buy domestic products over foreign imports.\n","n":0.04}}},{"i":350,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chain Weighted Inflation","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\nA chain-weighted inflation measure takes into account changes in both price and spending patterns. A chain-weighted inflation index measures both changes in the price of goods but also reflects changes in the number of goods bought.\n- ex. people make substitutions in their purchases as prices rise\n\t- surely this must be highly dependent on the example, and lower earners must be more subject to it. It's conceivable to believe if money is tight you will substitute beef for chicken, but it's difficult to imagine even a middle class family making that sacrifice.\n\nChain-weighted inflation measures tend to give a lower inflation rate than standard inflation rates.\n- This is because if goods go up in price, you buy less of them.\n\nHowever, in the traditional measure of CPI, the weights are not changed often (at a minimum once/year)\n\nA US federal law passed in 2017 applied the chain-weighted CPI instead of primary CPI for adjusting the incremental increases in income tax brackets. By switching to this metric, the increases on tax bracket adjustments will be comparatively smaller each year. This move to chain-weighted CPI is expected to push more citizens into higher tax brackets over time, thereby increasing the taxes they owe and, in turn, increasing the tax revenue collected by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nbetween January 2000 and April 2021, primary CPI increased by 57.6 percent, but chain-weighted CPI only increased by 49.6 percent.\n\n### Onions and shallots example\nImagine we have shallots and onions which are both $2.00/kg. At this price, we buy 2kg each (4kg total; $8). Now imagine that the price of shallots increases to $3.00. If onions and shallots were the only item in the basket of goods, it would imply a 25% rate of inflation. However, what would more likely happen is that people would just start buying less shallots and substitute them with onions. Looking from this lens, we would say that inflation is actually 0%.\n- A chain weighted inflation measure would take into account the fact you no longer buy shallots.\n","n":0.055}}},{"i":351,"$":{"0":{"v":"CPI","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nThe CPI either understates or overstates cost-of-living increases.\n- known as the index number problem.\n\nThe CPI is supposed to represent the average Canadian household's spending habits. For this reason, a weighted average is used.\n- ex. Canadians spend approximately 16% of their household budget on Food, (which further breaks down in other categories), 27% on Shelter, and 19% on Transportation, etc. This overall level of our spending is factored into the calculation of the CPI.\n    - This shows how it is inherent in the model of the CPI that we are talking about averages here. There is no single individual that exists that will pay *exactly* 5% more from last year if CPI is 5%. What results is a bell curve, and each individual may reside on either side of that average.\n\nThe CPI also breaks down how much weight each province is given in the calculation.\n- ex. Ontario carries an expenditure share of 39.83%, which means that consumption in Ontario represents 39.83% of all household consumer spending in Canada\n- ex. British Columbians contribute more to overall consumer spending than Yukoners, so the changing prices in B.C. will be given more consideration.\n\nIf the province's consumer expenditure on a particular commodity is negligible, then it may be withheld from the calculation\n- ex. The average Albertan's yearly expenditure on fuel is so low that it isn't even included in their CPI calculation.\n\n### Base period\nThe CPI is arbitrarily set to equal 100 in the index base period.\n- meaning all index values express price change in percentage terms in comparison to the index base period\n- ex. if the index is 123.4, that means prices have increased 23.4% since the base period. As of 2021, the index base period of the CPI is 2002.\n\n# UE Resources\n- [Stats Can CPI Portal](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/subjects-start/prices_and_price_indexes/consumer_price_indexes)\n- [Limitations of CPI](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/012915/what-are-some-limitations-consumer-price-index-cpi.asp)\n- [Consumer Price Index (CPI) vs. Producer Price Index (PPI)](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/011915/what-difference-between-consumer-price-index-cpi-and-producer-price-index-ppi.asp)\n","n":0.057}}},{"i":352,"$":{"0":{"v":"Driving","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n### Parallel parking\nMake sure you have 1.5x the length of your car.\n1.

Add a little more heat and caramelisation takes over, while too much heat for too long leads to burnt flavours.\n\nTo use tomato paste correctly you need to saute it in the early stages along with onions and garlic, as opposed to just adding it to the sauce\n\n### Roast Garlic or Onions first?\nIt depends on what you want to achieve:\n- If you want to flavor the oil and therefore the whole dish evenly you gently heat up the garlic in oil first and take it out once it’s starts to turn yellow. If you would put in the onions first, all its water would make the garlic cook instead of fry. Same with using cream in any dish involving garlic: before usage, heat the cream together with garlic to flavor the fat (you can basically put anything in there beforehand, herbs, parmesan, mushroom powder etc., it’s a game changer).\n- If you want to have garlic pieces and thereby recognizable garlicky highlights (especially for rougher pasta sauces which include bigger tomato or eggplant pieces etc.), then put it in after the onions.\n\n* * *\n\n# Marinade\nParts of a marinade:\n1. some form of acid to tenderize (1 part)\n    - soy sauce, lemon juice, orange juice & even Dr.Pepper!\n2. an oil (3 parts)— which serves as the component of fat\n3. flavor\n\nhttps://www.seriouseats.com/basic-marinade-for-stir-fried-meats-recipe\n\n## Chicken Marinade\nA chicken marinade should have four key components: fat, acid, seasoning, and time. You can play around with these in endless combinations.\n1. Fat. Fat plays two roles in a marinade. It transfers flavors that are fat-soluble to the meat (meaning you won’t be able to taste other ingredients as well without fat). Fat also helps to keep the meat moist. 99% of the time, I use olive oil. Vegetable oil is another excellent, neutral option.\n2. Acid. Acid tenderizes the meat by breaking down its fibers. Citrus juices, vinegar, yogurt, and buttermilk are four excellent options. For today’s recipe, I am using lemon juice. Lemon pairs beautifully with chicken and is easy to have on hand.\n3. Seasoning. Here the possibilities are truly endless! Citrus zest, herbs, aromatics (like onion and garlic), and spices can all come into play. The one non-negotiable is SALT. I use either kosher salt or, for even more complexity, soy sauce and a dash of Worcestershire.\n4. Time. MARINATING LONGER IS NOT BETTER! The ideal amount of time to marinate chicken is 5 to 6 hours, but even 15 minutes makes a difference. See below for more.\n\n# Tips\n- just a little oil added to the butter gets whatever you're cooking nice and crispy on the outer edges and prevents the butter from burning.\n\n### Mushrooms\nCleaning Mushrooms\n- Wipe each mushroom over with a damp paper towel for soft pastry brush if needed to remove loose dirt and debris. Work one at a time.\n- Lightly rinse under cold water and thoroughly pat dry with paper towel.\n- Avoid soaking mushrooms as they will absorb water like a sponge and won’t brown during cooking.\n\n### Meat\nRule of thumb: The thicker the meat, the lower the cooking temperature. The thinner the meat, the higher the heat. When in doubt, cook low and slow.\n- Hot and fast works for thin, skinny foods like skirt steaks (shown here), asparagus, and shrimp because skinny foods cook quickly. If you want a good dark brown sear (and you do) you need high heat to make that sear without overcooking the interior.\n- It is easier to hit the bullseye of a slow moving target. You stand a better chance of getting the food done to the proper temp without overshooting the mark when you cook low and slow.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-07-25-22-24-25.png)\n\nthe optimum internal temp for most pork and beef is around 130 to 135°F\ncuts like beef brisket, pork shoulder, and ribs are too tough to eat at ~130°F, due to a lot of connective tissue.\n- if these cuts are brought to 203°F or so, fats melt and the tough stuff softens up.\n\n- When cooking meat in the oven, keep the piece close to one another so the juiciness isn't lost to evaporation\n- Lean meat (ex. pork chops) will dry out quicker in the oven\n\n#### Steak\n1. Put a little bit of olive oil in the pan,\n2. go to super high heat for one minute on each side,\n3. kill the heat\n4. put in garlic butter and spoon it over the steak until 125 degrees (for med-rare)\n","n":0.036}}},{"i":362,"$":{"0":{"v":"Bbq","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nWhen cooking at full power you usually want the lid open so heat is being applied only to the bottom surface, and you want to turn the food often, like a rotisserie, so the hot side cools quickly, to keep the serious direct radiant heat focused on the surface and not allow weak reflective heat to cook the top and thus overcook the center.\n\n## Meat\n### Thin meat\ne.g. for skirt steak and other really skinny pieces of meat: Put it in the freezer for about 30 minutes to get it cold.

You are trying to get an interview, you are trying to secure a contract etc. Now is the time to raise expectations to the roof. Once you've secured what you are after, now is the time to lower expectations. If you just got them to sign a contract to deliver 10,000 instagram followers, say to your client \"ok there will be a quiet period at first, but we will gain more quickly over time, with 1000 in month one, and 10,000 by 6 months\". Set a level for yourself that is lower than what you can actually deliver, and then overdeliver it. - ex. Imagine job hunting. You set high expectations in an effort to get the interview, but then you need to take your foot a bit off the gas. Manage expectations at this point, such as communicating that you've been burnt out recently, and that you've been trying to take a break from coding to focus on mental health. This will cause the person to adjust their anchor downwards in regards to your performance.

Use the simple ‘Diver Test’\nUse the ‘Diver Test’ to optimize your resume for any job\n\nOne slow Wednesday afternoon I found myself in the office communal kitchen with a coworker whom I didn’t know very well. Eager to nudge the hour hand towards 5:00, we struck up a conversation. It turned out that Brent was the hiring manager for the department, and he was feeling accomplished because he had just brought on the newest addition to his team. Not only this, but he told me that he had never been so impressed with a candidate in his entire life!\nNaturally, I assumed that he must have had an impressive background. So I asked what company he worked for.\n“I don’t remember”, he casually replied.\nBaffled, I asked what product he sold at his previous job.\n“He didn’t” was his response.\n“What do you mean?”\n“He’s never sold a product in his life”\nSo, I asked, “why did you hire him then?”\n“Because he was so brilliant at selling himself”\nI’m sure my curiosity could be read quite easily, and had to know: why was this man so impressive, and where did he learn to sell so well if he’s never even had a sales job?\n“He used to be a diver,” Brent interjected, responding to my obviously confused expression. “And that fact alone did not impress me. What did impress me so much was how he was able to tie diving and sales together.\n“I’d love to hear this” I replied, and let Brent explain the interview.\n“When he came in, we sat down and his body language immediately showed he was comfortable. This is the first thing I look for in all candidates. Nervousness is natural and ok, but there has to be some level of comfort that can be grown into. “\nCheck #1.\n“After some back and forth, we went through his resume, including his most recent profession in diving, which he had done for the past 10 years. I asked him, ‘Why the switch from diving to sales? Why do you think you’ll make a strong salesman?’”.\n“His response blew me away, because he explained that being a diver taught him how to manage his time effectively. He went on to describe how as a diver, you have a limited amount of oxygen. This means you must always be aware of your progress in relation to how much time is left. If you are not on track to meet your goal, you must make adjustments on the fly. Failure to meet those goals is not an option, because it greatly reduces your efficiency and will end up costing the company money.”\nThis response stunned me, because it completely opened my mind to how efficient humans can be, and how skills, competencies and knowledge gained are different for everyone, even given the same experiences as someone else.\nHe continued on.\n“Next, he described how while underwater, it is vital to be able to work with co-workers to complete tasks within small windows of opportunity. He said, ‘I have learned how to truly depend on my co-workers. This has led to me becoming an incredibly team-focused individual.’”\n“After that point, he continued to express how through diving, he has learned to remain calm in the face of adversity, and how to face your fears to push your own man-made boundaries.”\nSuffice to say, the man was hired, and for good reason. \nExperience is not everything. What is everything, is what is gained from those experiences. \nA less observant diver perhaps would have seen himself as merely a specialist that has chosen an immutable career. He too would have learned teamwork and the ability to manage time, but it may have been limited to his job. He might not have believed in himself enough to apply those competencies to other areas of his life. Even if he did apply those things, his lack of awareness would have limited his ability to sell himself, and in effect limit the impact his abilities could have had on his life.\nThe Diver Test is a simple way to apply many of the varied experiences that you have had throughout your life to a new scenario. Every single person has experiences, and with those experiences come lessons. The mistake would be to limit those lessons to the medium through which they were learned. Instead, expand what you know, by leveraging what you have already learned in your life. \nSo ask yourself next time you are adding something to your resume: does it pass The Diver Test?\n\n","n":0.026}}},{"i":375,"$":{"0":{"v":"Recruiting","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nFinding people’s genius begins by carefully observing them in action, looking for spikes of authentic enthusiasm and a natural flow of energy.\n","n":0.213}}},{"i":376,"$":{"0":{"v":"Negotiation","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nPeople operate by reference points. \n- ex.

Otherwise nothing will be said, and their feelings of having been unjustly treated will blow up on you.\n\n* * *\n\nby making declarations that the person is likely not to agree with 100%, you put them on the defensive.

This stuck in my mind as remarkable, and I think of this event from time to time.\n\n### 3 Reasons people talk\n- They love your company\n- they want to feel good \n- they want to belong to a group\n\n### Five T's of WoMM\n- Talkers - Who will tell their friends about you?\n- Topics - What will they talk about?\n- Tools - How can you facilitate travel of the message?\n- Taking part - How should you join the conversation?\n- Tracking - What are people saying about you?\n\n## UE Resources\n- www.wordofmouth.org\n","n":0.055}}},{"i":380,"$":{"0":{"v":"Website","n":1}}},{"i":381,"$":{"0":{"v":"Paywall","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n### Showing ads in your website\n- paywalls are hostile.

Therefore the purpose of the landing page must be relevant to whatever ad they clicked on\n\t- what is the goal with this landing page?\n\t\t- generate awareness? \n\t\t- to get them thinking about new experiences while they are in travel mode?\n- A hook that piques their interest. needs to be relevant to why they clicked to the post in the first place\n\t- Of course, this will differ depending on if we are marketing towards Tattlers or Travellers.\n\t- *examples*\n\t\t- *where will you let the world take you?*\n\t\t- *ready to leave the tour bus behind, and really start to explore the world?*\n\t\t- *the evolution of experiential travelling*\n- Create buzzwords that pique interest?\n\t- *experiential travelling\n- have a clear objective\n\t- *filling out a form*\n\t- *clicking on a \"sign up\" button*\n- CTAs should be colours that contrast with background\n- Think of the page as a funnel. \n\t- The widest part of the funnel represents the wide variability of different users\n\t\t- different purposes for being there\n\t\t- different levels of wariness, or general willingness to try new things\n\t- the narrow part represents the common goal that we ultimately want to get as many visitors as possible to achieve.\n- Convince, rather than sell\n\t- Don't come off as trying to sell your product. Rather, come off as trying to make a persuasive argument for why your offering is the best way forward. You don't need to even mention your product early on. Just get them convinced that it's time to change whatever method they are currently employing in their lives.\n\t- Once they are convinced, it will be natural for the visitor to have your brand in mind (they clicked on your ad, after all). At most, do some light mentioning of the brand, but be extremely careful not to come off as sales-y\n\t\t- People hate to be sold on things. People love to find solutions to their problems.\n- Make the webpage as scannable as possible, with use of bullets and headings.\n- Don't be afraid to include a good level of convincing material on **specially designed landing pages** (SDLP) (ie. those designed to be lead to from digital marketing means)\n\t- People are accustomed to knowing that \"scroll down for more info\" is a thing. If they want more info because their interest is piqued but they aren't yet convinced, they can do that. However, it's not a necessity, and the experience is not negatively impacted otherwise.\n- For **specially designed landing pages** present the picture of the current state of the world, then proceed to show how the world is *with* the product you are offering in it.\n\t- Make sure that image is realistic otherwise people won't relate to it\n\t\t- ex. don't portray the world as one where you can only carry around 30 songs on an mp3 player. That's not the state of the world anymore, and no one will resonate with it.\n\t- The best is if the current state of the world is not good, but people don't realize that. Then, if you are able to show that the state of the world is not good and have people realize that, they will most be open to suggestion, since a large void was just created and that void needs to be filled.\n- make use of animations, both static and within the video\n\t- Even better if you can make \"static\" images that aren't so static (using slight csv animations)\n- In SDLPs, be sure that the point is emphasized that whatever you are offering is NOT what the visitor dreads or is afraid of\n\t- ex.

I've been active on reddit for over 8 years and I don't like ads either, so sorry for invading your feed.\n\nBut we've been hard at work for years building the Caliber workout app and I want to get the word out.\n\nMore importantly, I want to help people get better results from their fitness routines. Or even just discover a really cool workout app built by people who are in love with strength training.\n\nNow onto the good stuff.\n\n \n\nCaliber is a workout app for iOS and Android with evidence-based workout plans, seamless tracking, lessons on strength training and nutrition, specialized metrics, Apple Health & Google Fit integration, and more.\n\nThe app is 100% free with no ads, no paywalls, and no 3rd party tracking (see \"How do you make money?\" below).\n\n \n\nWhat's included:\n\nEvidence-based workout plans. Caliber workouts are based on fundamental principles of strength training. Think compound lifting, progressive overload, proper rest times, mastery over variety, etc.\n\nDon't want to use our pre-built plans? No problem, you can still track your own in the app.\n\nWorkout tracking. Easy entry for sets and reps, quick access to historical exercise data, one-tap autofills, exercise substitutions, and custom notes for each exercise (I like to use this to keep track of the power rack setup for specific exercises).\n\nDetailed instructions for 500+ exercises. Nearly every exercise in our database has detailed written instructions, a short video showing the form, and “takeaways” that you can use as a quick reminder on the most important form pointers to remember.\n\nA bunch of exercises have more detailed videos with breakdowns on setup and movement, and we're continuing to work on expanding these.\n\nStrength Score and Strength Balance metrics. People tend to get hung up on scale weight, especially when you're trying to both build muscle and lose fat. We created Strength Score as a way to measure relative strength, or in other words, how strong you are relative to your body weight. It's a great way to measure your progress that goes beyond just looking at the scale.\n\nStrength Balance shows you how well-balanced you are across major muscle groups.\n\nWeekly lessons. It's not enough to just blindly follow a workout plan, it's important to understand some basic principles around training and nutrition to ensure that you keep making progress. Education is a big part of what we do, and helps people from getting sidetracked by the latest fitness fads.\n\nData integrations. The app syncs with both Apple Health and Google Fit, allowing us to pull in data from nutrition tracking apps (i.e. Cronometer), step counts, body stats, and cardio workouts not logged directly in Caliber. This means you can see all of your fitness data in one place.\n\nGroups. This is a new social feature we've been working on that allows you to work out virtually with friends, seeing real-time workout activity and PRs. Kinda like Discord but built for fitness. This feature is in its early days but we're already having a lot of fun with it.\n\n \n\nIf the app is free, how do you make money?\n\nI get it, the whole \"If you're not paying for the product, you are the product\" thing. But that's not how we work. We don't have any ads in the app at all, nor do we lock off any functionality.\n\nIf you're on iOS, you won't even see the dialogue box that asks you whether or not you want to allow this app to track you. That's because we don't even have the framework that allows for this type of tracking in our codebase (IDFA for those of you who care).\n\nThe way we make money is that a small percentage of our users choose to pay for Caliber online coaching. For people who want additional motivation, more personalized guidance for their fitness goals, or are working around specific injuries or limitations, coaching is a great option. But it is absolutely not required to use the free app.\n\n \n\nNext Steps\n\nCome join us over at r/caliberstrong.\n\nThere, you'll find instructions for downloading the app, tips to get started, and personal help from me and the Caliber team.\n\nWe'd also love your help.\n\nWe've come a long way with the app, but we're not even close to being finished yet, and we'd really appreciate your feedback on how we can make it even better.\n\nIf you just want to download the app without joining the sub, you can find it here: https://caliber.app.link (or search for Caliber on the Apple App Store or Google Play Store).\n\nFeel free to comment if you have any questions!","n":0.036}}},{"i":391,"$":{"0":{"v":"Influencers","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nTrying to motivate influencers through discounts or rebates won’t work.

In Keyword Explorer’s \"SERP Analysis\" report, you can view the pages that are ranking for the term you're targeting, as well as how many backlinks those URLs have. This will give you a good benchmark for determining how many links you actually need in order to compete and which websites might be a good link target.\n When targeting sites for backlinks, you can prioritize by how authoritative they are using Domain Authority and Page Authority metrics.\n\nKeyword rankings\nA website’s ranking position for desired keywords. This should also include SERP feature data, like featured snippets and People Also Ask boxes that you’re ranking for. Try to avoid vanity metrics, such as rankings for competitive keywords that are desirable but often too vague and don’t convert as well as longer-tail keywords.\n\nPageRank is calculated at the page‐level, not the domain‐level.\n\n## unlinked mentions\nhttps://ahrefs.com/blog/unlinked-mentions/\n even if you already have a link from elsewhere on a domain, it’s still totally worth pursuing an unlinked mention on a high‐authority (i.e., high UR) page on that same site to see if they will turn it into an <a> tag\n- Ahref content explorer - discover how many mentions your site has and find those who mention, but don't link\n\t- https://ahrefs.com/content-explorer\n- advanced google queries\n\t-intext:ahrefs -ahrefs.com -twitter.com -facebook.com -pinterest.com -youtube.com\n\t- look for the text \"ahrefs\" not on the following sites\n\t- filter for the past 24 hours to see the newest\n\t\t- scrape it https://www.chrisains.com/seo-tools/extract-urls-from-web-serps/\n\n## boost CTR\n- https://youtu.be/L_6zAGJ-JO4\n\nwrite long blog posts\n- 2000+ words\n- definitive guides pull in more views that shorter blogs\n- goal is to answer all questions that a googler would have related to their query\n- Analyze LSI keywords\n\t- LSI keywords are words and phrases that are strongly associated with your page’s topic.\n\t- https://lsigraph.com/\n\nFor example, let’s say that you just published an article about The Paleo Diet. LSI keywords would be terms like:\n- Nutrition\n- Caveman\n- Weight loss\n- Recipes\n- Grains\n\nAnd when Google sees these LSI keywords on your page, they think: “Awesome! This page obviously covers this topic really well.”\n- https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/lsi after finishing the article\n\nnow, just sprinkle these LSI keywords into your content\n- Publish Unique Data\n- Bloggers and journalists LOVE unique data.\n\nAnd if you can hook them up with a stat, a survey, or an industry study, they’ll throw links at your feet like rose petals.\nThis content contains lots of data that people can cite (like the fact that the average video on the first page of YouTube is nearly 15 minutes).\n\n## keyword research\nhttps://backlinko.com/keyword-research\n#### 1. Brainstorm a List of Topics\nHere’s where you come up with topics that your target customer is interested in.\n\nFor example, let’s say that you run a digital marketing agency.\n\nWell, you’d want to ask yourself: ”What topics do people search for that are related to my business?”\n\nSome topics that come to mind would be things like:\n\nSocial media\nEmail marketing\nWebsite traffic\nContent marketing\nBlogging\nPPC\n\n### 2. Use Google and YouTube Suggest\n- Now that you have a list of topics, type each one of them into Google.\nThese are great keywords to add to your list.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause if Google suggests a keyword, you KNOW that lots of people are searching for it.\n- check out the “Searches Related to” section at the bottom of Google’s search results.\n\t- Pro Tip: Click on one of the “Searches Related To” keywords. Then, scroll to the bottom of THOSE results. This will give you a new list of related keywords. Rinse and repeat.\n\t- Tip type out 'keyword a', then 'keyword b', all the way to Z to have Google suggest even more keywords\n\t\t- or use https://keywordtool.io/ \n\n#### 3. Reddit\nYou’d head over to Reddit. Then search for a broad topic that your target audience is interested in… and something that’s related to what you sell.\nPro Tip: Scrape common words and phrases from a subreddit with a free keyword tool called “Keyworddit”. This tool scans Reddit for words and phrases that people use… and sorts those phrases by monthly search volume.\n\n#### 4. Wikipedia Table of Contents\nFirst, head over to Wikipedia and type in a broad keyword:\nThen, look for the “contents” section of the page. This section lists out the subtopics covered on that page.\n\n#### 5. Find Popular Topics Using Forums\nGoogle:\n\n“keyword forum”\n“keyword” + “forum”\n“keyword” + “forums”\n“keyword” + “board”\n\nOnce you find a forum, note how the forum is divided up into sections: Each of these sections are potential keywords that you can add to your list.\n\ncheck out some of the threads on the forum to find other specific topics that your target audience struggles with\n\n### Focusing on long tail\nFirst, search for your keyword in Google.\nThen, look at the sites ranking on the first page.\nIf the first page is made up of uber authority sites (like Wikipedia), then you might want to cross that keyword off from your list:\nBut if you see a handful of smaller blogs on page 1, that’s a sign that you have a shot to hit the first page too.\ncanirank.com\n\n#### choosing which keywords to use\n-you must consider what \"high search volume is\" for the particular industry you are targetting\n\t- For example, a long tail keyword in the fitness niche (like: “best ab exercises”) gets 10K-100K searches per month, But a long tail keyword in a B2B space like digital marketing (like: “best seo software”) only gets 100-1K monthly searches.\n- That’s why you want to figure out what a “high” and “low” search volume number is in your niche. Then, choose keywords based on what’s normal for your industry.\n- organic link clicking is down due to:\n\t- ads taking top spots\n\t- featured snippets\n- Search volume only gives you part of the story. To get a full estimate of how many clicks you’ll get from a first page Google ranking, you also need to estimate organic CTR.\n\t- you can look at the SERPs (Search Engine Result Page) for your keyword.\n\t\t- If you see a lot of stuff on the first page (like a Featured Snippet and multiple Google Adwords ads), then you know that you’re not going to get a ton of clicks… even if you rank #1.\n\t- With all that said, don't avoid a keyword just because it has a low CTR. If lots of people search for that term, it might still be worth going after.\n\n#### CPC\nCPC (cost per click) is a single metric that answers one important question:\nDo people searching for this keyword actually spend money?\nSo yeah, search volume is nice and all.\nBut if the person searching for that keyword is broke, then there’s no point in targeting that term. Plus, you can sometimes get a great ROI from a keyword that doesn’t get that many searches… if the CPC is high enough.\n- For example, one of my target keywords is “link building services”. According to the Google Keyword Planner, this keyword gets around 10-100 searches per month. So if I ONLY looked at search volume, I’d say: “This is a horrible keyword”. That’s why it’s super important to ALSO look at CPC. The CPC on that keyword is $7.15. Which means that people are spending $7.15 every time someone searching for that keyword clicks on an ad. So even though the search volume for that term isn’t that high, the CPC more than makes up for it.\n\n##### Likelihood that someone clicking on your link will become a paying customer\nFor example, a few weeks ago I came across the keyword: “backlink checker”. On the surface, this is a great keyword. It gets a decent amount of searches, And has a $4.01 CPC. But considering that I sell a YouTube training course, this term is a 10/10 in terms of business fit\n\n##### Keyword Trends\nFinally, you want to see if your keyword is growing fast… or dying slow.\n\nAnd the best way to do that? Google Trends.\n\nFor example, last year I was considering the keyword: “voice search SEO”.\n\nBut I decided to pop that keyword into Google Trends before pulling the trigger.\n\nAs you can see, interest in that keyword is growing fast. Which is why I optimized this page around that term. Even though that piece of content only brings in about 1k monthly search engine visitors per month today, the trend tells me that traffic to this post should increase over time.\n\nsuppose you’re a web design company with a new plan to offer marketing services. You’re getting ready to launch the service and write a new, search optimized page for your own site. But should you call it: \n- web marketing\n- digital marketing\n- internet marketing\n\nEnter those three phrases into Google Trends and here’s what you’ll see Digital marketing is most trendy.\n- Google Trends also shows geographic differences, which can be important if you’re targeting a local audience. Even though digital marketing is most popular, consider where the audience is.\n\n##### Barnacle SEO\npractice of using other sites’ authority to rank on the first page.\nBottom line? If you find an amazing keyword, you want to take up as much first page real estate as you can. First, create content on that topic on your own site. Then, publish keyword-optimized content on authority sites, like YouTube, LinkedIn, Medium and more.\n\n##### GSC Keyword Research\nGSC > Performance Report\n- This report shows you the terms that bring in the most clicks from Google search.\n- sort the list by “Impressions”.\n\t- This shows you keywords that get lots of impressions… but not necessarily clicks\n- Finally, create a piece of content optimized around that same keyword.\n\t- These are keywords that you KNOW people are searching for. You also know that Google sees your site as a good fit in the search results. You just need to publish content that’s super focused on that specific keyword (or optimize a piece of existing content around that keyword) and you’re set.\n\n##### Optimize Content around Synonyms and Related Keywords\nIf you are optimizing for \"build backlinks\", sprinkle throughout your content \"get backlinks\" and \"generate backlinks\"\n\n##### Ahrefs Content Gap\n- use Ahrefs to see the exact keywords another site ranks for.\n\t- Head over to Ahrefs content gap. And put in 2-3 competing sites.\n\t- This will show you keywords that at least 2 of your competitors rank for… but you don’t.\n\t- And because multiple competitors rank for these terms, you know that you also have a good chance of cracking the top 10.\n\n##### Navigational keywords (avoid these)\n- people searching for \"ahrefs\" are most likely looking for www.ahrefs.com\n- this means that very few people click on anything but the first result\n- so a particular keyword may look great, but this wouldnt be a good keyword to optimize for, as you will not get much traffic compared to the first result.\n- This is why focusing on *searcher intent* is so important\n\n##### Find “Shoulder Keywords”\nMost people ONLY optimize their site around keywords that are very closely related to what they sell.\n\nAnd it’s a BIG mistake for two main reasons:\n\n1. Keywords that people use to find your products are usually super competitive.\n2. There are thousands of keywords that your potential customer searches for when they’re not searching for that you sell.\nFor example, like I mentioned earlier, I run an SEO training company.\nBut I don’t optimize every page on my site around commercial terms. (Like “SEO training” and “SEO courses”). Instead, I rank for keywords that my customers search for when they’re not looking for SEO training. (Keywords like: “link building”, “on-page SEO” and “SEO Tools”).\nthese keywords are “Shoulder Keywords”. \nThese keywords aren’t directly related to what you sell. But they’re keywords that your customers search for. Which makes them worth going after.\n-Let’s say you run an Ecommerce site that sells basketball hoops. Obviously, you’d want to optimize some of your pages around terms like “buy basketball hoops online”. But don’t stop there. After all, someone interested in buying a basketball hoop may also search for: \n- How to shoot a better free throw\n- Slam dunk highlights\n- How to get recruited by college scouts\n- Nutrition for basketball players\n- How to improve a vertical jump\n\n#### evaluate top industry websites\n- find the topics/KWs that are in their menus, footers\n\n#### FAQ keyword research\nAnswerThePublic.com\n1. export to csv and delete non relevant KWs\n2. Search and filter “display keyword suggestions” by “are questions”\n3. Add relevant questions from answerthepublic.com to a new keyword list in Moz Keyword Suggestions\n- don't worry about evaluating search volume too closely for FAQs because questions are typically more long-tail\n\n#### Competitive content research\nsimilarweb.com - Evaluate your competitor’s 10 most popular pages\n- This uncovers the specific type of content your audience is interested in\n1. Evaluate each of the top pages & gather 3 key takeaways\n- example\n\t- The most popular “www.example.com/gallery” page confirms that images are extremely popular in the wedding and event space. Maintaining an optimized gallery and incorporating more images into on-page content should be a top digital marketing priority.\n\t- Interestingly, the “Preferred Vendors” page is a Category page! It's something we should consider implementing on Hunter & Co. It would also be a great link building opportunity (to get vendors to link back to Hunter & Co)... but I digress.\n\t- Testimonials should also be a top priority and live off the primary navigation.\n\nWhile researching competition, you’ll quickly notice that it’s perfectly normal for pages with low authority to rank relatively high. Typically in these cases, the page has stronger relevance. That page (or that entire website) is totally focused on the topic.\n\nAuthority is important, but it’s not everything. There are many other search ranking factors.\nHere is the general rule:\n- If the Domain Authority of your site is within the range of the domain authorities of the other, high-ranking websites, you should have a chance of ranking for the phrase. If not, go back and look for a longer, more specific, less popular but less competitive phrase.\n\t- Note: Page Authority, not Domain Authority is the real test. Ultimately, it’s the authority of our page versus the authority of their page.\n\t- But when we are making a new page targeting a new phrase, we don’t have a page authority to compare to! So use Domain Authority as a more general guide when creating new content and Page Authority when adjusting keyphrases and optimizing existing content.\n\nHere’s a simple way to research keywords fast. You can estimate your odds of ranking based on your Domain Authority and the keyword search volume or just number of words in the phrase. This is oversimplified for sure, but it may help give you an idea for what general range you should be in.\n- If domain authority is...\n\t- < 30, target keyphrases with  less than 100 searches/mo OR keyphrases of length = 5 words\n\t- < 50, target keyphrases with less than 1000 searches/mo OR keyphrase of length = 4 words\n\t- < 70, target keyphrases with less than 3000 searches/mo OR keyphrase of length = 3 words\n\n#### Expand your keyword reach with MozBar\n1. Activate MozBar. Enter in your primary keyword and click “optimize.”\n2. Click “On-Page Content Suggestions”\n3. View the content integration ideas for your webpage\n4.

That’s because your homepage is your strongest competitor with the most authority and the best chance of ranking.\n\nInterior pages, such as product and service pages, should be optimized for more specific phrases. Those phrases may have hundreds of searches per month. Search volume for a blog post’s target keyphrase may be even lower, with fewer than 100 searches per month.\n","n":0.019}}},{"i":394,"$":{"0":{"v":"Psychology","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nappeal to your customer’s meaning and purpose, or lack thereof\nYou have seconds to appeal to self-interest, and it all happens with your headline.\n\nRepetition is paramount.\n- Consistency breeds familiarity, familiarity breeds confidence, and confidence breeds sales.\n\nSome stories simply make you stop what you’re doing and consider them for a moment.

This technique is a killer way to prevent talking “at” or “to” your visitor – both of which tend to focus on YOU, not them – and to shape more engaging messaging that speaks with them.\n- Explore layers of benefits. Every feature has a benefit (at least, it’d better!). What’s interesting is that every benefit carries with it additional benefits. The primary benefit of your online course may be that users can do exercises at any time of day. Great. What’re the benefits of such convenience? Spending more time with the family; going at your own pace; doing exercises on vacation. Your copy should explore many layers of benefits.\n- Explicitly write who your product is “ideal for”. An “ideal for” statement on the home page and key landing pages tells visitors they’ve come to the right place, which can reduce bounce and exits and improve site exploration. The more crisp and specific to niches you get with this statement, the better.\n- Focus on “what’s in it for me” (WII-FM). What do your visitors want to know before they read, watch, sign up or buy? This: “what’s in it for me?” They don’t care about you, but they DO care that you care about them. So show you care by “tuning in to WII-FM” before you write or edit a word.\n- Scratch all instances of “we” + your company name. Scour your copy for the word “we” and for your company name, then delete those and rephrase the edited phrase so it’s focused 100% on what your prospect gets – not what you offer.\n\t- Only exception: “About Us” page. But even then, be careful.\n- Once you’ve deleted all “we” mentions, DO go in and add explicit “you” mentions. This turns a headline like “Manage Your Inbox Easily” into “You Can Finally Manage Your Inbox Easily” – which is a simple, elegant way to reinforce the fact that you have the solution for your visitor.\n- Repeat important messages. If you have an important message, don’t assume that just because you put it in your home page headline your visitors will remember it by the time they’re in your checkout process. Repeat persuasive copy wherever it will help visitors transact.\n\t- You may find that one click trigger overcomes several objections; for example, “money back guarantee” can overcome “I’m not sure I want to commit yet” and “I might not like it as much as I like my current solution”. Don’t worry if you’re not 100% sure! It’s the rare case when a salesperson is 100% sure their counterargument will neutralize a customer’s argument. Just get as close as possible.\n- Match your headline to the call to action that led visitors there\nA great way to lower bounce/exits is to create a seamless experience in which your visitors’ expectations are matched. So DO simple things like repeating or closely reflecting text-link copy in the headline of the landing page.\n- The easiest-to-read blog posts and emails are almost always those in which every sentence begins a new line. Same goes on your website. DO keep ‘paragraphs’ to 3 lines or fewer. The longer the line, the fewer lines you should stack into a paragraph / chunk.\n- The most compelling testimonials tell a story of what a customer’s challenge was before your product or service… and what the outcome of using your product or service was. Don't use airy-fairy testimonials like “You’re awesome”… unless you’re going to sprinkle them amongst meatier testimonials.\n- Don't Let your USP scroll away. Your home page headline – often your value prop / USP – should remain static + unmoving on the page. If it moves and your visitor didn’t get a chance to see it – or simply can’t recall it after reading the rest of your page – then what? Don't let your most critical messages appear and disappear.\n- Don't use round bullets for numbered lists. The symbol you use at the start of each point in your list should help scanning eyes. So if you have a list of 4 steps, use a numbered list. If you want to show a bunch of included features, use a checklist. If you want to break a paragraph into bullets in no particular order, use a bullet list.\n- Don't use dead-end pages. Every page needs a call to action. Dead-end pages are the devil. So make sure you make your call to actions clear on each page. In the following example, my only option as a user is to read about the next feature… but what if I’m tired of reading now and just want to sign up?\n- Don't Pull back when it’s time to close. Just because someone is on your Pricing (or Registration) page does not mean they are sold on you. If it did, you’d see 100% of your visitors to those pages convert. And I’m guessing that’s not the case. So here’s what you should do: put messages designed to overcome their pricing objections right on the Pricing page – like SOSonlinebackup does\n","n":0.034}}},{"i":400,"$":{"0":{"v":"Content","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nDon't make the ad about you or your product/service.

The operations of an organization are like a “black box” in that you can’t see everything that’s happening on a daily basis. Indicators let you “cut holes” in the black box to get a view on what the output of the organization might be in future. Train your team to select a small number of objective, quantifiable measures of output, with leading and trending indicators, that can be reviewed daily and help transform a business for the better. Avoid measures of activity, subjective measures and unquantifiable measures. Your job is to identify, closely monitor and effectively manage the “vital few” indicators of performance over the “compelling many”.\n\n* * *\n\nNever join a team and start making changes right away. The right to make changes comes with understanding, and understanding comes through time. Be patient. Observe how they operate.

I started my career as a UI/UX designer, but quickly realized the limitations of not knowing how to code. I taught myself front-end development and became the sole developer in a small local start-up. I then expanded my skills to become a full-stack developer, playing key roles as a system architect and database administrator. With a proven track record of being able to learn quickly and continuously improving my skills, I am able to quickly adapt to new technologies and understand how they fit into the bigger picture of the architecture. I like to see myself as the tide that rises all boats; A versatile and adaptable support team member who is able to jump in and perform a multitude of varied tasks as they present themselves.\n\n#### Spoken\nOk, so my unique value perspective that I bring.

From there, my curiosity got the better of me, and I expanded my skills to move more into the backend, becoming a full-stack developer. I joined another startup, and since no one else volunteered for the job, I played the role of database administrator and served as one of the principal system architects administrator.","n":0.042}}},{"i":414,"$":{"0":{"v":"System Design","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n![](/assets/images/2023-07-24-21-01-42.png)\n- [source & elaboration](https://vahid.blog/post/2022-05-05-system-design-interview-cheat-sheet/)\n\n# Early Considerations\n## Define scope\n1. Describe the potential surface area of the application, listing out features. Anything is on the table\n2. Constrain the scope with the interviewer\n    - What domain primitives do we have?\n\n## Back-of-the-envelope\n- How much main domain data are we storing?\n    - ex. if Spotify, how many songs are we storing? If Facebook, how many posts are we storing?\n- How many users?\n\n## User traffic patterns\n- How many daily active users (DAU)? \n- How many concurrent users anticipated?\n\nHow does the typical user use our application?\n- *Sequential Access Pattern* - Users follow a sequential or linear path through the application or website. \n    - ex. in a step-by-step registration process or an e-commerce checkout flow, users move from one page to the next in a predefined sequence.\n- *Random Access Pattern* - Users access different pages or features of the application in a non-linear, unpredictable manner. They commonly arrive directly from search engine results, bookmarks, or external links.\n    - ex. Wikipedia\n- *Bursty Traffic Pattern* - Occasional spikes in traffic or usage, typically caused by specific events, promotions, or viral content.\n    - ex. Ticketmaster pre-sales\n- *Daily/Weekly/Seasonal Traffic Pattern* - Consistent variations in user traffic based on specific days of the week or times of day. \n    - ex. e-commerce platforms experience higher traffic during holiday seasons.\n- *Recurring Traffic Pattern* - Users return to the same pages or features regularly \n    - ex. daily news readers or social media platforms.\n\n## Rough high-level component design\nOnce we have all high-level components in place, run through a use-case\n- ex. in Spotify, when a user plays a song, the selected songId is sent from the client to the application server, which sends a query to the relational database to get the song record. Included in the song record is the URL where the `.mp3` is stored in the blob storage database...\n\n### Database\n- SQL or NoSQL?\n- Rough table design\n\n* * *\n\n## Fault tolerance\n- [[deploy.distributed.CAP-theorem]]: should *availability* or *consistency* be prioritized?\n- automatic leader promotion on failure\n- RDBMS provides a WAL for improved fault-tolerance\n\n## Scaling\n- Microservice architecture for independent scaling of nodes\n- Offload non-critical tasks to a job-queue (implemented with something like Redis streams or Apache Kafka)\n- what is the `read:write` ratio?\n\n* * *\n\n# Database\n## Main app\n### Write-heavy databases\nConsider how read-heavy the data in your application is. Write heavy dbs may face scalability issues. \n- For instance, maybe 5x more people are uploading data than are downloading it (a 1:5 read:write ratio). Let's assume 1M writes per day, giving us 5M reads\n\nThings to consider\n- Does read data need to be consistent with what was just written? If not, we can cache.\n- Efficient indexing (recall that indexes slow down write operations)\n- query optimization necessary\n- Batching write queries to reduce overhead of establishing connections, executing queries and committing transactions.\n- offload write operations to an asynchronous processing mechanism (e.g. queue)\n- implement replication and sharding to distribute writes across multiple replicas\n\nIf using counters (likes, votes etc.), use distributed counters to distribute load\n\nCan implement caching mechanisms using Redis to reduce load on database\n\n### Read-heavy databases\nThings to consider\n- Implement efficient indexing on read-heavy sets of data\n    - Identify the most frequently executed queries and create indexes on the relevant columns to support them.\n- Implement caching mechanisms\n- Use replication to distribute load over multiple replicas\n- Use load balancing to distribute load over multiple application servers\n- Consider denormalization to reduce amount of joins needed\n- Query optimization\n\n### Scaling\n- Implement read replicas\n- Vertically scaling the database to upgrade CPU, RAM and storage\n- Sharding (ie. horizontal scaling) the database can help distribute the load\n\n### Storage\n- Consider moving a certain subset of the data to cold storage to save on costs\n\n## Authentication\n- Handling large number of registrations and logins will put strain on auth service\n    - Consider holding a separate database for our auth service, which will issue JWTs to autenticated users, and will verify JWTs.\n\n# Static content\n- serving static content and handling increased traffic will put a strain on the server and affect the user experience.\n    - leverage a CDN to offload static asset serving and improve load times.\n\n# Cache\n- Managing cache validation and ensuring consistency of content across distributed servers can present challenges\n    - Implement cache versioning and cache invalidation strategies (e.g., using cache headers or file hashing) to maintain consistency.\n- We can cache some of the hot data points that are frequently accessed. Following the 80-20 rule, meaning 20% of hot data points generate 80% of traffic, we would like to cache these 20% data points.\n    - ex. if designing a paste-bin clone, cache the top 20% of most accessed pastes.\n\n# Application Server(s)\n- if there is concurrently high number of writes to database, make use of message queue like Kafka to decouple the write (eg. Reddit post submission) from the main application \n\n# Scaling and High Availability\n- Scaling the system and maintaining high availability across multiple regions can be complex.\n    - Employ horizontal scaling by adding more servers and use load balancers to distribute the load.\n    - Implement an automated monitoring and alerting system to help identify and address issues\n    - Employ failover mechanisms to automatically switch to backup systems in case of failure.\n- Coordinating data replication and ensuring consistency during updates are challenges.\n    - Techniques like database replication, data partitioning, and distributed caching can enhance availability and scalability. \n\n* * *\n\n## Capacity Estimation and Constraints\nCan users upload as much as they want? For instance, if we were building Instagram, we would want to make efficient storage of photos a top priority.\n\n### Leveraging User Expectations\nHave a good understanding of user expectations while designing the application. For instance, in an Instagram-clone, it's not necessary that every user sees the latest content at any given time— we can tolerate some delay. This enables us to retract our focus from strict caching and replication implementations, and instead focus on things that are more important for our system.\n\nHow fast do writes need to be? How about reads?\n- For Instagram, fast uploads would not be expected by users. Reads, on the other hand would be expected, since there is a high degree of swiping going on. For this, we'd want to have a more sophisticated caching system in place.\n- We should keep in mind that web servers have a connection limit before designing our system. If we assume that a web server can have a maximum of 500 connections at any time, then it can’t have more than 500 concurrent uploads or reads. To handle this bottleneck, we can split reads and writes into separate services. We can have dedicated servers for reads and different servers for writes to ensure that uploads don’t hog the system. This has the added benefit of being able to scale each set of services independently.\n- If users can upload a large amount of data, then efficient management of storage should also be a focus\n\nHow reliable is your app expected to be?\n- if you are Instagram, your users expect 100% reliability. Therefore, you should store multiple copies of each file so that if one storage server dies, the photo can be retrieved from the other copy present on a different storage server.\n    - If we want to have high availability of the system, we need to have multiple replicas of services running in the system so that even if a few services die down, the system remains available and running. Redundancy removes the single point of failure in the system.\n\n### Redundancy\nAll potential bottlenecks and points of failure should be scrutinized. Think of how the system gets more complex as we implement [sharding|db.strategies.sharding]. Now we need a sharding rule to determine in which shard a row is stored. Suppose we implement round robin with `recordId % 10` to spread out the records evenly. Well, now we have a new problem: we cannot have the shards increment the IDs themselves, since we need the ID first before we can even determine which shard it belongs in. So to solve that, we need some sort of external key generating service. This service can generate IDs, store them in a table (to indicate that it is used) when a new item is created. Each shard can use this service, and we can have perfectly incremented IDs across all shards. However, one last issue arises. This key generation system is now a single point of failure, so we have to iterate further. We could spin up another such key generating service, and split the load between them by having one service give out even-numbered IDs and the other odd-numbered IDs. Finally, we can stick a load balancer in front of them to round-robin the load between them. In case of failure of the even-numbered service, the only consequence is that there will be more odd-numbered IDs; something we probably don't even care about.\n\n### Back-of-the-envelope Estimations\nFrom there, assume that each item is 10KB, so we need to store 10GB per day. If we want to store this data for an average of 10 years then we need storage capacity of 36TB.\n- To keep some margin, we will assume a 70% capacity model (meaning we don’t want to use more than 70% of our total storage capacity at any point), which raises our storage needs to 51.4TB.\n\nNew items per second:\n- 1M / (24 hours * 3600 seconds) ~= 12 pastes/sec\nresults in\n120KB of ingress per second.\n- 12 * 10KB => 120 KB/s\n\nReads per second:\n- 5M / (24 hours * 3600 seconds) ~= 58 reads/sec\nresults in\ntotal data egress (sent to users) will be 0.6 MB/s.\n- 58 * 10KB => 0.6 MB/s\n\nThis number of records totals 3.6 Billion in 10 years. Since 6 random [[base64 encoding|binary.encoding.base64]] ([A-Z, a-z, 0-9, ., -]) can be used to generate 68.7 billion unique strings, this should be sufficient for uniqueness.\n\nSince we have 5M read requests per day, to cache 20% of these requests, we would need:\n- 0.2 * 5M * 10KB ~= 10 GB\n\n\n* * *\n\n## Dendron notes to review\n- [[auth.tokens.jwt]]\n- [[api.gateway]]\n- [[deploy.distributed.CAP-theorem]]\n\n## E Resources\n- [Slack architecture](https://systemdesign.one/slack-architecture/)\n- [Back-of-the-envelope analysis](https://systemdesign.one/back-of-the-envelope/)\n\n## Resources\n- [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)\n- [Distributed counter design](https://systemdesign.one/distributed-counter-system-design/)\n- [Real-time presence design](https://systemdesign.one/real-time-presence-platform-system-design/)\n- [Live comment system design](https://systemdesign.one/live-comment-system-design/)\n- [Leaderboard system design](https://systemdesign.one/leaderboard-system-design/)\n- [Pastebin system design](https://systemdesign.one/system-design-pastebin/)\n- [URL shortening system design](https://systemdesign.one/url-shortening-system-design/)\n- [Service Discovery](https://systemdesign.one/what-is-service-discovery/)\n- [Various system designs](https://hackingthesystemsdesigninterview.com/)\n- [System Design and Architecture](https://github.com/puncsky/system-design-and-architecture)\n- [System design cheatsheet](https://systemdesign.one/system-design-interview-cheatsheet)\n- [Youtube series: System Design](https://www.youtube.com/@IGotAnOffer-Engineering)","n":0.024}}},{"i":415,"$":{"0":{"v":"Algorithm","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nPay close attention to the requirement of the question.

Depriving them of volatility, randomness, and stressors will harm them.\n- Consider that being overprotective of a child effectively reduces volatility. This is harmful to them\n\nAntifragility determines the boundary of what is living and organic (like the human body) and what is inert (like a stapler on your desk)\n\nAntifragility is measured on a spectrum \n\nAn antifragile thing benefits from stressors only up until a degree\n- ex. Your body benefits from some degree of mishandling (e.g. exercising), but not too much. \n\nThe amount of debt a company has increases fragility\n\nBy focusing on something’s degree of fragility, we can determine what the impact would be if a shock were to occur. This is far more useful than trying to predict the shock itself\n\nAnything that has more upside than downside from random events (or certain shocks) is antifragile\n\nEverything that has life in it is to some extent anti-fragile, but not the reverse.\n- A human body can benefit from stressors, but only to a point. But a dish, a car, an inanimate object will not. Sure, this may be robust, but cannot be anti-fragile\n- Many things such as society, economic activities and markets, and cultural behaviour are man-made, but grow on their own to reach some kind of self organization. They are not biological, but they resemble the biological in such a way that they multiply and replicate (e.g. rumors, ideas, technologies, and businesses).\n\nSystems where those in power have no skin in the game tend to fragilize society\n- ex. Consider that bankers, academics and bureaucrats have very little downside to their decisions. \n- It is a relatively recent phenomenon that non-risk takers are able to exert so much influence on society. Normally, those who had real power had also taken large risks to get to where they were.  \n\nAntifragility is the antidote to the [[black swan|statistics.probability.black-swan]]. \n- Fragile things are exposed to negative black swans, while antifragile things are exposed to positive black swans.\n\nFragility is measurable; risk is not (particularly risk associated with rare events).\n\nDegree of fragility/Antifragility mean potential harm/gain from exposure to something related to volatility.\nThat *something* can be...\n- uncertainty\n- Variability\n- Imperfect and incomplete knowledge \n- chance\n- Chaos\n- Volatility\n- Disorder\n- [[science.concepts.entropy]]\n- Time - time is functionally similar to volatility: the more time, the more events, the more disorder\n- The unknown\n- Randomness\n- Turmoil\n- Stressor\n- Error\n- Dispersion of outcomes\n- Unknowledge\n\n### Antifragility of information\nConsider that information is naturally antifragile. The more we try to burn books and silence thought, the more it comes back with a vengeance.\n\n#### The banker, the cab driver and the artist\n- The banker is fragile. He dresses the same conservative way every day and is concerned about his reputation. The more info that gets out about him, the more harm is done to his reputation.\n- On the other hand, the cab driver doesn't have much in the way of status, so he doesn't really care as much about his reputation. He isn't fragile like the banker, but isn't antifragile either.\n- The artist is the most antifragile. He could go out on the street and punch his biggest rival in the mouth, and it wouldn't do much to harm his book sales. In fact, it will make him more infamous, thereby helping his booksales. He can dress in increasingly outlandish ways, and it still won't hurt his reputation.\n\n* * *\n\nThe Antifragility of some comes necessarily at the expense of the fragility of others\n- In other words, it is a zero sum game\n\nIn a system, the sacrifices of some units, i.e. the fragile ones, are often necessary for the well-being of other units or the whole\n- For us to end up at an anti-fragile economy, we must have many fragile start ups. This is what enables entrepreneurship to work in the first place\n- The collective of restaurants is anti-fragile, but it is made up of fragile restaurants. Consider that if each restaurant was not fragile, the concept would never have evolved past a simple sandwich at a table. That business model failed because of the fragility of restaurants. That is, better ideas came around and replaced them for the betterment of the whole restaurant landscape.\n\nAntifragile systems benefit from randomness (think [[evolution|evolution]] and random mutations)\n- up to a limit. A meteor crashing into earth is beyond the limit of what nature can handle\n- consider The phenomenon of antibiotic resistance. The harder you try to harm bacteria, the stronger the survivors will be, unless you can manage to eradicate them completely. This is why you have to finish antibiotics when you are prescribed them\n\n### Biology works because of layers\nThe cell has a population of intracellular molecules. In turn, the organism has a population of cells, and the species has a population of organisms.\n- A strengthening mechanism for the cell comes at the expense of some intracellular molecules. Likewise, a strengthening mechanism of an organism comes at the expense of cells, and the strengthening mechanism of the species comes at the expense of individual organisms.\n\nThe economy is not anti-fragile in the way that is currently implemented. Consider that every plane crash makes flying overall more safe, because we are able to learn from it. Furthermore, the negative impact of a single plane crash is confined and not able to bring down the whole system (ie. all planes). On the other hand, the economy is linked in such a way that errors spread and compound\n- The economy is relatively fragile because of the presence of government bailouts. The whole concept of bailouts is transferring fragility from the collective to the unfit.\n\n* * *\n\nAn adaptive system is one that changes its behavior based on information available at time of utilization (as opposed to having the behavior defined during system design). This characteristic is sometimes referred to as cognitive. While adaptive systems allow for robustness under a variety of scenarios (often unknown during system design), they are not necessarily antifragile. In other words, the difference between antifragile and adaptive is the difference between a system that is robust under volatile environments/conditions, and one that is robust in a previously unknown environment.\n\nis similar to hormesis in biology or creative destruction in economics\n- Hormesis is defined by the dose-response relationship. Something at a high dose or concentration may be dangerous, but at a lower dose that same “something” can be beneficial. \n- ex. vaccinations\n\nRobustness is enduring to stress with no harm nor gain. Resilience involves adapting to stress and staying the same.\n\nThere is some Antifragility built into variable careers like taxi drivers, prostitutes, carpenters, and dentists. They don’t get a consistent pay check every week, which puts them continuously under pressure to be fit to be able to absorb and pivot in the face of any kind of financial threat\n- this is why it is illogical to think of salaried employees as being the more conservative position to take. If they get laid off, they instantly go to $0 income and are normally unprepared to get another job right away\n- this it can be said that the salaried employee is more vulnerable to black swan events\n- Stressors are information. The salaried employee doesn’t get any stressors, and thus cannot continually adjust the same way someone in a more antifragile profession can. The person in the antifragile profession sees their income slowly change, rather than all at once, giving them ample time to respond to that information\n\nAvoidance of mistakes leads to a fragile system. It makes the large ones more severe\n\nThe more variability you observe in a system, the less black swan-prone it is\n\nFragmented systems with little interdependence are antifragile because randomness is distributed rather than concentrated.\n- ex. there will never be a generalized restaurant crisis (unlike banks), since each unit is independent and competes with others.\n- ex. back when city-states dominated (e.g. Venice, Genoa), the threat of war was small-scale. Compare that to a massive country like U.S going to war (WWI + WWII), which has much larger impacts. City-states had regular, but small skirmishes. Empires have (sometimes) irregular, but massive wars.\n\n* * *\n\nCommunism is fragile, because humans are naturally greedy, and when humans are greedy in a communist society, things collapse. Capitalism on the other hand is at the very least robust, and maybe even antifragile. That is, it more greed proof, since it uses a natural human tendency to be greedy to benefit the whole.\n\nTime is the ultimate exposing mechanism of fragility. Consider that it is not impressive for a person to pick a single well-performing stock. It is more impressive that a person picks many well-performing stocks. But most impressive is when a person picks many well-performing stocks over a long period of time.\n\nTo make money off fragility you just need to identify fragile systems and bet on their collapse\n\n[[stoicism]] is Antifragility in its purest form: there is an upside-downside asymmetry\n\n* * *\n\n### Fragility-robustness-Antifragility as a replacement for predictive methods\nRather than trying to predict the occurrence of an event, it’s more useful to understand how fragile a system is\n- ex. When Arab spring happened in 2011, Obama blamed It on bad intelligence. In fact, what happened was just the hair that broke the camels back. Such events are completely unpredictable. It is the system that lies underneath that is worth examining. The system was a fragile one, making it inevitable to have happened at some point.\n- anal: It would be useless when building a bridge to try and predict which truck would cause the bridge to fall down. That is missing the point entirely.","n":0.025}}},{"i":420,"$":{"0":{"v":"Anticipation","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nThere is a cost to spontaneity.
