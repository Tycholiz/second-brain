$$
π = {circumference \over diameter}
$$

$$
A = {πr^2}
$$
- where `A` = Area of a circle; `r` = radius

A circle has about 80% of the area of a similar-width square.
- The actual value is $(π/4) = 0.785398... = 78.5398...%$
- ex. a square with area of 0.16m² would correspond to a circle with area of ~0.128m²

- A line that "just touches" the circle as it passes by is called a *Tangent*.
- A line that cuts the circle at two points is called a *Secant*.
- A line segment that goes from one point to another on the circle's circumference is called a *Chord*.
    - If it passes through the center it is called a Diameter.
- An *Arc* is a subsection of the diameter
