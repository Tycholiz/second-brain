<p><em>Noise</em> is junk data that must be accounted for in any type of statistical analysis. Signals are the good part of the data spectrum that are contrasted with noise. </p>
<p>Noise increases with the frequency of data</p>
<p>If we get a condensed version of the news just once per year, the signal to noise ratio might be 1:1. If on the other hand we watch it every day, it might be more like 50:1. </p>
