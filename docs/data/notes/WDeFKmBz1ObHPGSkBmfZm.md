### Email script for a cold call where the recipient is terse and has no time
“Hi (Name), 

Kyle here, the gent who just called you. Sorry for the unexpected call. Understand the timing is not always appropriate. I spent a reasonable amount of time researching (Company)… and thought from my reading...

*Insert findings and potential value (I even attached in the text body a screenshot of the article I had read about them).

*Insert product video in action (ideally relating to said findings and potential value). If you do not use video email yet check out: Loom, Vidyard, BombBomb. All good stuff.

Of course, no idea to date what systems you are using but would love to learn more about (Company) and see if we may be a fit to help you achieve your objectives with XYZ.

Any interest in a quick-connect when it is better timing?”
