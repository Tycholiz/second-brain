When making a stereo mix, individual mono tracks still need 2 channels each, since the sound will be heard in 2 outputs (e.g. 2 pads on headphones, 2 speakers etc.). Hence, if we did not 2 channels we would not be able to pan the sound; Each sound would be straight down the middle.

Channels can be used to send a signal to multiple destinations. 
- ex. we could set up a vocal track with 4 channels, and stick an EQ FX on it that only receives inputs from channels 3+4. Then we can add another FX instance (maybe even another EQ instance) on the same track that only receives inputs from channels 1+2. In this way, we can control the 2 sounds separately and then blend them together into a single sound using Channel Mixer (another FX to exist at the end of the pipeline).
