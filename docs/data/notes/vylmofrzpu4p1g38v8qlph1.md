A cadence is the end of the phrase that provides some sort of resolution.
- a cadence is characterized by its degree of *strength* or *weakness*, depending on the impression of finality it gives.

Cadences are strong indicators of the tonic or central pitch of a passage or piece.

Cadences are usually classified by a specific chord progression, but even if that progression is played, it doesn't necessarily imply a cadence. To be a cadence, it must occur at the end of a phrase and provide some sense of finality.
- ex. an Authentic Cadence is `V-I`, but that doesn't mean every time those 2 chords are played it is a cadence. 

### Authentic (V-I)
A seventh above the root is often added to create `V⁷`

Authentic cadences are generally classified as either perfect or imperfect.
- *perfect* (PAC) - the chords are in [[root position|music.theory.chords.inversion#root-position,1:#*]] and the tonic is in the highest voice of the final chord.
  - considered the strongest type of cadence and often found at structurally defining moments.
- *imperfect* (IAC) - of which there are 3 types:
  - *Root position*: Similar to a perfect authentic cadence, but the highest voice is not the tonic.
  - *Inverted*: Similar to a perfect authentic cadence, but one or both chords are inverted.
  - *Leading-tone*: The V chord is replaced with the `vii°` chord (but the cadence still ends on `I`).

*"This cadence is a microcosm of the tonal system, and is the most direct means of establishing a pitch as tonic. It is virtually obligatory as the final structural cadence of a tonal work."*
