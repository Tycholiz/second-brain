Overestimation happens when sensationalism takes place.
- consider how the images of beached whales have had their stomachs cut open, and plastic has poured out. This gives us the impression that this happens all the time, and that it is a major issue. In fact, this problem (while still an issue), is small compared to other problems plaguing the ocean. This bias causes people to focus their attention often on the wrong thing.
