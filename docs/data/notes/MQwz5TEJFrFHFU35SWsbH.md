### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
- purpose is to estimate value of an investment based on the future cash flow the company will have.
- if the return value of the formula is above the stock price, consider investment
- DCF loses relevance when:
	1. the project is complex
	2. the growth rate is high (since high growth rate can't be sustained)
		- this point might be heavily contested if one were to consider the high-growth of a stock like Apple or Microsoft
- can be used to value any type of investment (ex. PP&E)
