<p>The deceptive thing about a graph is that its shape changes as vertical axis grows (ex. price of a stock when plotted against time). The consequence of this is that we may look at a hockey-stick graph and intuit that "it's reached it's peak. It can't go up anymore". However, what was once a steep curve becomes flatter and flatter as the Y-axis (price of stock) values get higher and higher. In other words, if each millimeter of Y-axis was $100 before, it is now $500. The consequence of this is that those previous gains now look more modest in retrospect, because the slopes aren't as steep.</p>
