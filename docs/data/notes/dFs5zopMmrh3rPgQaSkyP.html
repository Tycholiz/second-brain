<p>How to compose a successful critical commentary (Daniel Dennett):</p>
<ol>
<li>You should attempt to re-express your target's position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, "Thanks, I wish Iâ€™d thought of putting it that way."</li>
<li>You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).</li>
<li>You should mention anything you have learned from your target.</li>
<li>Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.</li>
</ol>

<li>criticism of taste, </li>
<li>criticism of the person themselves, whether it was a personal attack or attack of the person's work.</li>
