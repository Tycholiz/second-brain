## Double tracking
Doubling is extremely effective in creating depth and space
- Doubles can be panned together adding depth and unique character, or they can be panned apart to add width.
- ex. try panning them wide during verses, and centre during chorus
- ex. try panning early verses/choruses wide, but pan centre during later ones for added intensity.

note: breaths and sibilance (s’s and t’s) can be extremely distracting when out of time. As such, they can simply be removed completely from Vocal2.
- Also, consider reducing the s’s and t’s in the doubles with de-essing so as not to clash with the main vocal.

Consider not always using double tracking on every word. Save double tracking for emphasis on select lines to emphasize a lyric.

Consider using a different microphone for Vocal2, which will create some separation, texture and depth in the vocal mix.

To create a lot of vocal power, consider having two separate vocal doubles. Pan the main vocal centre, and pan each double track hard left and right respectively.

### Types of Double
- Unison (ie. Double)
- Octave - singing an octave higher/lower than main vocal line. Tuck it a little lower in the mix than the lead vocal
    - ex. [falsetto double](https://youtu.be/bhh6alcX7Yo?t=419)
    - ex. [lower octave double](https://youtu.be/bhh6alcX7Yo?t=444)
- Melodic interval
    - ex. https://youtu.be/bhh6alcX7Yo?t=509

### Try
- vocal1 panned centre, and vocal2 panned hard left, with slight delay panned hard right
- lead vocal panned centre, with 2 unison double tracks panned hard left and right to result in a thick vocal
- lead vocal panned centre, with 2 lower octave double tracks panned ~50% left and right, so as to support (and not distract from) the lead vocal
