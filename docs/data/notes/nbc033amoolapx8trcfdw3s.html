<p>Don't get caught up in the idea of different woodwinds as a hierarchy. Woodwinds differ from strings in that the timbre of each instrument is remarkedly different. Don't make the mistake of only letting flute carry the melody because it's the highest.</p>
<ul>
<li>also consider mixing up the hierarchy (e.g Try an oboe tune above a low register flute)</li>
</ul>
<p>The woodwind section as a whole is rich in overtones. If you’re clever with wide open chords, the harmonic gaps get filled in.</p>
<p>steer clear of dull chordal blocks and doubling. Endlessly held notes will bore your players and worse, waste an opportunity.</p>
<p>Woodwind instruments like to move, even when the music is slow.</p>

<p>3rd and 6th intervals between woodwind instruments sound nice</p>
<p>Go for an energetic zippy high flute against a lazy mid-register oboe, Move the clarinet about within the gorgeous depths of its chalumeau register below a plaintive high legato bassoon. If you’re after rhythmic punch, ask for fortissimo staccato attacks. They’ll rival the brass section for power.</p>

<p>Flutes have difficulty playing loudly at bottom of their range.</p>
<p>Flutes get louder as they go higher</p>

<h3 id="clarinet">Clarinet<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#clarinet"></a></h3>
<p>Clarinets are often thought of as having 3 distinct registers: chalumeau, clarion, altissimo</p>
<p>The clarinet is capable of more extreme crescendi or diminuendi than any other wind instrument. It can purr like a cat or blast everything else out of the water.</p>
<p>Clarinets get louder as they go higher</p>
<h3 id="bassoons">Bassoons<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#bassoons"></a></h3>
<p>Bassoon and oboe, an octave apart, are a match made in heaven. Make the most of the bassoon’s tenor register.</p>
<p>Bassoons have difficulty playing quietly at the bottom of their range</p>
<p>The bassoon is the quietest instrument in the entire orchestra.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want a melody to cut through, write above middle C.</li>
