<p>Diversity shouldn't be about getting as many people from different cultures/races. Instead, it should be about "diversity of thought". Yes, different cultures/races often come with diversity of thought, but that is not the only way to achieve it. You could also have a group of white men who can achieve diversity of thought. Perhaps it is less likely, but the notion of diversity as a function of your skin colour or culture is not the only determining factor, and to think so would be ludicrously ignoring the many other factors that can make you a diverse thinker.</p>

<li>to think that a group of white people can't bring diverse thoughts is actually going counterpoint to what the <a href="/notes/MmjHaByLtYx5sv2HzXnWd">woke culture</a> would think. If they believe that a group of white people can't be diverse, then that might lead one to think that they view white people as all having the same upbringing, background and experiences.</li>
