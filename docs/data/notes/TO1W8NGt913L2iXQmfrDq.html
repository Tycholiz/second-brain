<p>Retained earnings has little practical significance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Retained earnings is not an asset and it certainly is not cash.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="depreciation">Depreciation<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#depreciation"></a></h3>
<p>with rare exceptions, business fixed assets are overdepreciatedâ€”not in the actual wearing out or physical using up sense but in the accounting sense.</p>
<ul>
<li>the reported book values of a company's fixed assets (original cost less accumulated depreciation) are understated. A company's fixed assets are written off too fast. Book values shrink much quicker than they should.</li>
</ul>
