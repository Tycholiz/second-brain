<ul>
<li>aka Major-Minor 7th
Major triad with a minor 7th (ie. of the minor scale; 2 semitones below octave)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, dominant refers to how it's used (<a href="/notes/i7t4qrzsj38kvn1wlz88rjs">function</a>), unlike the other 7th chords which refer to how the chord is made (ie. by using a 7th or flattened seventh)</p>
<p>Usually built on the fifth degree of the major scale</p>
<p>Dominant seventh chords contain a strong dissonance— a tritone between the chord's third and seventh.</p>
<p>The dominant seventh is perhaps the most important of the seventh chords. It is useful because it contains both a major triad and the interval of a tritone. </p>
<p>The V7 chord is found almost as often as the V, the dominant triad, and typically functions to drive the piece strongly toward a resolution to the tonic of the key.</p>
<p>Because of this original usage, it also quickly became an easy way to trick the listener's ear with a deceptive cadence. The dominant seventh may work as part of a circle progression, preceded by the supertonic chord, ii.</p>
<p>Importantly, non-diatonic dominant seventh chords (sometimes called a chromatic seventh), borrowed from another key, can allow the composer to modulate to that other key.</p>
<p>In popular rock and roll songs following the blues progression, the IV and V are almost always dominant 7ths</p>

<p>Minor triad with a major 7th</p>
<p>In C, has pitches C-E♭-G-B</p>
<p>Works well in <a href="/notes/iorrkggbnibkt9wkh4qlc43#harmonic-minor1">harmonic minor</a> when played as the <code>i</code> chord.</p>

<p>Diminished triad with a minor 7th (2 semitones below octave)</p>
<p>This is known as half diminished because if we split this chord up into 2 halfs (the triad-side and the seventh-side), only one of the halves is diminished (the triad half), while the seventh half is still just a minor 7th.</p>
<p>Though the chord is more commonly used to increase dissonance in a more minor way, it can also be used to express more uplifting emotion, as is found in the first chord (following the fanfare) of Mendelssohn's Wedding March</p>

<p>Diminished triad with a diminished 7th (3 semitones below octave)</p>
<p>This is a very jarring sounding chord</p>
