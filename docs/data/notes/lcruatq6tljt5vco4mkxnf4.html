<p>A major 6th chord is identical to the minor 7th of the relative key (albeit in a different inversion)</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. C6 is the same as Am7</li>
<li>writing a chord as 6th instead of the equivalent 7th is obscuring the harmonic quality of the chord, making it more difficult to know which notes belong.
<ul>
<li>there is one exception to this, which is dependent on the context. Imagine we play a <code>Cmaj7</code> chord, then drop the 7th to a 6 to play a <code>Cmaj6</code> chord. In this context, the <code>C</code> still feels like the tonal centre (as it did with the <code>Cmaj7</code> chord). In this case, it's more appropriate to think of that 6th chord as a 6th chord and not a 7th of the relative key.</li>
</ul>

<p>When specifying a minor/major 6th chord, the minor/major refers to the third (meaning the 6th note is the same in both)</p>

<p>It is not a tense chord, and therefore doesn't require resolution.</p>
<p>Considered a substitute for the tonic in Jazz</p>
