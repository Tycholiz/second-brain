<p>Similar to how gold is a bearish sign for the economy, lumber is a bullish sign of the economy
Lumber can be thought of as a proxy for domestic consumer strength (due to housing)</p>
<p>Generally when lumber is weak compared to gold, small caps outperform large caps. Small caps are more sensitive to changes in the domestic economy; while large caps are more multinational. </p>
<ul>
<li>The logic may follow that when the us economy is doing well, youâ€™d want to own more small caps.</li>
</ul>
