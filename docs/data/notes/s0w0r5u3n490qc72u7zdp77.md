## $n!$
most basic use is to count the possible distinct sequences – the ([[repeatable|math.combinatorics.combinations#combinations-with-repetition]]) permutations – of $n$ distinct objects
- "there are $n!$ different ways of arranging $n$ distinct objects into a sequence."
- ex. we have a square, a triangle and a circle and we want to know how many different combinations of order we can make ([triangle, circle, square], [circle, triangle, square] etc.)
    - Here, there are $3!$ combinations, or 6.

A factorial is a multiple of all values less than the factorial value
- ex. 240 ($5!$) is evenly divisible by 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1
