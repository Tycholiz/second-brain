when using a website, sometimes we get a pop up that is from the website's marketing. it may say something like "want to get more insights? sign up to our mailing list". however, it may be smarter to have a different question. In the case of Never Forget, we might say something like "how would you like to remember 95% of what you learned instead of forgetting 95%?". the natural inclination here might be to respond to the question, rather than understanding the underlying action, which is "do you want to sign up for our mailing list". this theoretically should increase the success of that pop up.
