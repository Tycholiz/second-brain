## Tensor Ranks
The rank of a tensor is equivalent to how many `[]` it has
- ex. `[6, 4]` represents a vector and has a single pair of brackets, so is therefore of rank 1.
- recall that scalars, vectors and matrices are types of tensors

### Scalar
A scalar is a tensor of rank 0, because scalars have no directional indicators, and therefore need no indices
- they do however represent quantities with magnitude

Mathematically, a scalar is of rank 0 because $N^{0} = 0$

### Vector
A [[vector|math.algebra.linear.vector]] is a tensor of rank 1, meaning there is 1 index (or, basis vector) per component
- that is, when we have a vector in a 2D space, we are able to represent a vector with coordinates (e.g. $$(2,4)$$). Each component (here, the $x$ and the $y$ are each a component) needs only a single index.

Mathematically, a vector is of rank 1 because a vector in N-dimensional space can be represented by $N^{1} = N$ numbers.
- ex. to represent a vector in 3-Dimensional space, we need 3 indices

### Matrix
