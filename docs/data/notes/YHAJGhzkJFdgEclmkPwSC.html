<p>just seeing something in a certain place primes you to expect that thing to happen again </p>
<ul>
<li>ex. Seeing a car burning on first at exit 66 on highway 99. If we see a fire burning here again, we are less surprised because system 1 designates this spot "the place where cars burn"</li>
<li><strong><em>ex.</em></strong> that spot on River Road near Tidewaters Pub will always be the spot where cops do radar, since I got a ticket there once</li>
</ul>
<p>primed ideas have some ability to prime other ideas, although more weakly. Like ripples on a pond, activation spreads through a small part of the vast network of associated ideas.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, whenever you saw certain letters together, like c/d, v/d, c/v, you'd see <em>coronavirus/covid-19</em></li>
</ul>
