<p>When thinking it terms of percentages, be wary of if a total is being added to, or reduced from. If the total is being added to, then the percentage we add to the total gives us the cumulative return of the whole new total. However, if we are subtracting a percentage from the total, then the amount of the % return is actually a number <em>higher</em> than the one the total was reduced by.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. When putting money into an RESP, the government matches 20%. We are adding to a total. $1000 + 20% is $1200. In a way, 20% return right off the bat. Straightforward. But imagine we are talking about a discount. For instance, buying shares in your company through an ESPP gives you a 15% discount, this does <em>not</em> mean that we are getting a 15% return right off the bat. Here, we are reducing from a total. If we were buying $1000 worth of shares without ESPP, the cost of those shares <em>with</em> ESPP would be $850. Since we can go ahead and sell those shares on the open market immediately for $1000, we have made a return of $150 over the $850 investment:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>( 1000-850 ) / 850 = 17.6%.

<p>if you ever have to calculate a difficult percentage on the spot without pen and paper or a calculator, you can use a simple shortcut - flip the numbers around.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. if you needed to work out 4% of 75 in your head, just flip it and do 75% of 4, which is easier</li>
</ul>
<p>This basic principle – simply stated as <em>"x as a percentage of y = y as a percentage of x"</em></p>
<ul>
<li>this trick works simply because of the fact that <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>×</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>×</mo><mi>a</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a × b = b × a</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6667em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">a</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span><span class="mbin">×</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">b</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.7778em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">b</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span><span class="mbin">×</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">a</span></span></span></span></span> (known as <em>Commutative Laws</em>)</li>
