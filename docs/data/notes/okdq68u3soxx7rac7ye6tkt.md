### Dominant 7th (e.g. `C7`)
- aka Major-Minor 7th
Major triad with a minor 7th (ie. of the minor scale; 2 semitones below octave)

Here, dominant refers to how it's used ([[function|music.theory.chords.function]]), unlike the other 7th chords which refer to how the chord is made (ie. by using a 7th or flattened seventh)

Usually built on the fifth degree of the major scale

Dominant seventh chords contain a strong dissonance— a tritone between the chord's third and seventh.

The dominant seventh is perhaps the most important of the seventh chords. It is useful because it contains both a major triad and the interval of a tritone. 

The V7 chord is found almost as often as the V, the dominant triad, and typically functions to drive the piece strongly toward a resolution to the tonic of the key.

Because of this original usage, it also quickly became an easy way to trick the listener's ear with a deceptive cadence. The dominant seventh may work as part of a circle progression, preceded by the supertonic chord, ii.

Importantly, non-diatonic dominant seventh chords (sometimes called a chromatic seventh), borrowed from another key, can allow the composer to modulate to that other key.

In popular rock and roll songs following the blues progression, the IV and V are almost always dominant 7ths

### Major 7th (e.g. `Amaj7`)
Major triad with a major 7th (ie. of the major scale; 1 semitone below octave)

### Minor 7th (e.g. `F♯min7`)
Minor triad with a minor 7th (ie. of the minor scale; 2 semitones below octave)

### Minor-Major 7th (e.g. `CmM7`)
Minor triad with a major 7th

In C, has pitches C-E♭-G-B

Works well in [[harmonic minor|music.theory.scales.minor#harmonic-minor,1:#*]] when played as the `i` chord.

### Half-Diminished 7th (e.g. `C°7`)
Diminished triad with a minor 7th (2 semitones below octave)

This is known as half diminished because if we split this chord up into 2 halfs (the triad-side and the seventh-side), only one of the halves is diminished (the triad half), while the seventh half is still just a minor 7th.

Though the chord is more commonly used to increase dissonance in a more minor way, it can also be used to express more uplifting emotion, as is found in the first chord (following the fanfare) of Mendelssohn's Wedding March

### Diminished 7th (e.g. `Cø7` or `G-7♭5`)
Diminished triad with a diminished 7th (3 semitones below octave)

This is a very jarring sounding chord
- *"diminished sevenths were to feature regularly in music to evoke the uncanny or sense of impending danger."*
