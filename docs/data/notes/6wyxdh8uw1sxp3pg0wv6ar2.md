## Mono
Mono (short for monophonic) means one channel of audio. 
- when recording a microphone into an audio interface using one microphone and one channel, that is the definition of mono

When we have a mono signal in our DAW, eventually it gets sent to a stereo bus. Itâ€™s technically still mono information, but that same mono signal is now sent both to L and R. This is what creates a centre image.
- Mono information in a stereo environment equals *centre information*. As our ears hear the same thing from either side at the same volume and at the same time, our brains localise that as centre

## Stereo
Stereo (short for stereophonic) means more than one channel of audio. 
- precisely, it is the reproduction of sound using 2+ independent audio channels

### Stereo Image
Stereo width is achieved when what comes out of the left is different to that of the right.
- ex. when tracking guitars, record the same part twice and pan them left and right respectively. This works because they are two different pieces of audio, giving off a sensation of width.

A wide stereo image is when a sound seems to be coming from multiple angles (like a wall of sound)
- the more different the sound out of L is from R, the wider the stereo image. The more similar L is to R, the narrower the image.
