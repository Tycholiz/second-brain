FHSA gets 8k contribution room per calendrer year.

FHSA can carry over a maximum of 8k. This means the most contribution room you can have at once is 16k. (ie, if you only deposit 4k during 2024 you would only have 16k again in 2025 instead of 20k).

The deadline to contribute for your 2023 taxes is Dec 31.
