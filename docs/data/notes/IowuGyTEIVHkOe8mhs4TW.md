### Gold and the market
- as ↑interest rates, ↓gold
- as ↑$USD, ↓gold
- Gold is often sold at times of distress in the stock market as investors sell anything they can to meet margin calls.
    - a contrarian perspective may be, "why is gold the only asset available to an investor to sell in time of distress? Is it that it has retained its value well during the crash (comparatively speaking), and so instead of selling off heavily deflated stocks, the investor sells the more well supported gold?"
