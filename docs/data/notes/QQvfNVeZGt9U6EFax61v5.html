<p>There's a benefit in being naive in some aspects of the world. If I didn't know the protocol for quitting a job, I wouldn't know that is to give 2 weeks notice, and leave. Instead, I'd have to think through it from scratch, allowing my principles and values to form my own protocol. I might decide to go out and find my replacement, train them, then give my notice on quitting day, introducing my boss to my replacement. This is kind of a nice thing to do, and being naive allowed that to happen
