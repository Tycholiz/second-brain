A security you hold does not "know" on which exchange you've bought it, it just exists as a holding in one of your accounts.
Some brokers also define "sub-accounts", e.g., TD Waterhouse has separate CAD vs USD, cash vs margin vs short, etc.

Journaling is the process of moving a holding from one (sub-)account to another. Usually it requires a phone call and there is no charge for it.
