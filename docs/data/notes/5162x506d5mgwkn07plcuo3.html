<p>Stoicism can be summed up as <em>"indifference to fate"</em>.</p>
<p>It is about continuously degrading the value of earthly possessions. It is about the idea of harmony with the cosmos</p>
<p>About a fellow who led a lavish life, Seneca wrote “he is in debt, whether he borrowed from another person or from fortune”</p>
<p>It is a good practice to imagine ahead of time what the worst case scenario will be. This allows us to take an appropriate amount of risk and choose the right class of risk, and anything on top of that is just a bonus. In this way, any potential downside is clear and unambiguous.</p>

<li>this shows how stoicism is not about detaching yourself from emotions, but it is about domesticating them.</li>

<p>One needs discipline the most when things are going well</p>
