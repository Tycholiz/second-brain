<p>It’s better to write each part separately – your arrangement will sound more like a living string ensemble.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each line should be able to stand alone.</li>
<li>Rather than writing a series of block chords where everyone changes note at the beginning of the bar, introduce independent melodic movement. You give the player a chance to add expression. It varies the ensemble sound and helps the music breathe and come to life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t forget that a small string ensemble can be forcefully percussive as well as lyrically melodic.</p>

<p>there’s a lot of overlap between instruments. </p>
<ul>
<li>The viola, which is pitched a fifth lower than the violin, can sound great higher up within the lower violin range</li>
<li>all 5 instruments are capable of covering the G3-G4 register.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="violin">Violin<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#violin"></a></h3>
<p><em>"brilliant"</em></p>
<p>Violin1 usually plays higher notes than violin2</p>
<h3 id="viola">Viola<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#viola"></a></h3>
<p><em>"biting and nasal"</em></p>
<h3 id="cello">Cello<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#cello"></a></h3>
<p><em>"chest voice"</em></p>
<p>Try giving the melody to the Cello, and giving the bass line to the viola</p>
<h3 id="double-bass">Double Bass<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#double-bass"></a></h3>
<p><em>"penetrating"</em></p>
<p>Usually the double bass will get either the same notes as the cello but down an octave, or otherwise have a pretty simple bass line while the other string instruments bring in the complexity.</p>
