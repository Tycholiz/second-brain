### Negative Exponents
- $5^3$ is equivalent to $1 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5$ 
- $5^{-3}$ is equivalent to $1 รท 5 รท 5 รท 5$
    - it could also be restated as $1 \over 5^3$

### Mental Tricks
any number that is 1 followed by zero's (e.g. 100, 10,000 etc.) as an exponent can be figured out by multiplying the number of zeros by the exponential value and adding a 1 in front.
- ex. to figure out $100^3$, we take the number of zeros ($2$) and multiple it by the exponential value ($3$), which means the result has 6 zeros ($1,000,000$)

At the core of exponentials is the idea that something is increasing at a fixed rate over a fixed period of time.
- ex. Covid-19 infections double every 5 days.
