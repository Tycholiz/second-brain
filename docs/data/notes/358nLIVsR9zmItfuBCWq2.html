<p>Remember to never go to bed mad at each other</p>
<p>A good relationship principle is: whenever one has a complaint about the other, a promise should be made. One person should promise to work on the issue while the other promises to be patient with them.Â  </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Ex. I say fuck a lot when frustrated, I promise to try to cut back and she promises to be patient and supportive (however that person feels would be the best way to be supported)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Interdependence theory</p>
<ul>
<li>three determinants of whether a relationship will succeed
<ul>
<li>level of satisfaction
<ul>
<li>compared against an average benchmark of what constitutes a normal satisfying relationship</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>level of dependence</li>
<li>level of investment</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>if both individuals are satisfied with the intimacy levels, then sex can make up 10% of the overall satisfaction of a relationship. if there is dissatisfaction with the sex life however, those problems can make up 70% of the problems</p>
<p>never get "into it" about an event that happened years ago. just recuse yourself, "that event was so long ago that I cant possibly say with accuracy what may or may not have happened"</p>
