<p>Neurons are types of cells that can be programmed by us, by learning and repetition</p>
<ul>
<li>Neurons communicate through electricity and by releasing chemicals</li>
<li>The synapse is the interface between 2 neurons. The first neuron releases a chemical substance that is detected by the second, which then continues that electrical activity</li>
<li>Neuroplasticity - the more you practice something the more your brain changes. Every single neuron in the brain can form up to 10000 connections to other neurons. Those connections become more and more as we do something more and more</li>
</ul>
<p>Each neuron has a cell body with tiny branches called dendrites that receive information from other neurons. Extending from the cell body is long fibres called axons that send information to other neurons.</p>
<p>Since it is the connections between neurons that cause their mental capacities, it is not the number of cells that is important, but the number of potential connections between them</p>
<p>When a neuron fires an electrical impulse down the axon, the impulse is released as a chemical substance called a neurotransmitter. When this chemical reacts to a dendrite of another neuron, it triggers an electrical impulse. After, a series of chemical reactions begin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Another neurotransmitter is serotonin. Serotonin is linked with mood and emotion. Too much stress can lead to low levels of serotonin, and low levels are associated with anxiety and depression.</li>
