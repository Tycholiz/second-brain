Think of the notes of a key as different pieces of punctuation. The root is like the period, since it brings some sense of finality. The 4th is like a comma, which implies there is more to come.

The 3rd is the most melodic part of the key. To make phrases sound more melodic, give more prominence to the 3rd.

## Relative key
Two keys are relative if they contain all of the same notes
- ex. C and Am

The relative minor is 3 semitones below the tonic of the major scale
- ex. 3 semitones below the C is A, meaning that the relative minor of C is Am

## Modulation
- Also known as key change

Modulation to the subdominant key often creates a sense of musical relaxation, as opposed to modulation to the dominant (fifth note of the scale), which increases tension.
- ex. If we are playing in C major, modulation to the subdominant means a key change to F
