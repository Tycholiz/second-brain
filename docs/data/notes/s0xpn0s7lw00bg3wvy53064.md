## What is it?
The envelope of a sound is the journey that the sound takes from its inception to its ultimate completion. In other words, it describes how a sound changes over time.
- there are various types of envelope
  - ex. an amplitude envelope describes how the amplitude of a sound changes over time
    - amp envelopes are most common, particularly when talking about acoustic (ie. non-digital) sounds

consider the plucking of a guitar string. As we hit the string, the sound reaches its absolute peak.

Instruments don't make sounds the way lamps make light: it's not "all" or "nothing."
- instead, the sound wave is composed of 4 sections:

## ADSR
The combination of ADSR describe how a sound changes over time.

### Attack
The attack controls the time taken for the sound to reach its peak from nil.
- in the case of an amplitude envelope, it is the part of the envelope where amplitude is still increasing. 
  - In other words, it is the time taken for amplitude to reach max level.

Most natural instruments have a very short attack, meaning they reach max amplitude very quickly.

A slow attack can be perceived as a sort of fade-inâ€” as we press the key down, it takes a more significant amount of time before the sound reaches its peak amplitude.

### Decay
The decay controls the time taken for the envelope to decrease from its peak to the sustain level. 
- in the case of an amplitude envelope, the part where amplitude starts to decrease. This phase starts as soon as the attack phase reaches its peak.
- in real spaces high frequencies often decay quite fast while bass frequencies stick around much longer. 

### Sustain
the period during which amplitude remains constant
- many natural instruments (e.g. guitar) don't have a sustain phase

While attack, decay, and release refer to a length of time, sustain refers to level (e.g. in case of amp envelope, a volume level).
- often, sustain is quantified by a % of the peak value
  - ex. with an amplitude envelope, a sustain of 70% means that the sustain phase of the envelope is at 70% of the amplitude of the peak's amplitude value.

### Release
the final reduction in amplitude.

On piano, this would be the time it takes for the sound to reach 0 amplitude after we take our finger off the key.

### Example: envelopes of different instruments
ex. If you press a piano key and release it, the sound changes volume gradually over time. 
- First, it rises quickly (or "attacks") to its maximum volume. 
- Next, the sound "decays" to a lower level and stays there or "sustains." 
- Finally, when we let go of the key, the sound "releases" and dies down to silence. 
- In a piano, the attack phase is fairly slow and the sustain phase can be really long as the notes take a long time to die away. 

- ex. With a flute, the attack phase is quicker and sharper, there is little decay, the sustain continues for as long as the flautist keeps blowing, and the release is also very fast.
- ex. With the strike of a drum, you have an almost instant attack, a longer decay (depending on what material you're hitting), and effectively no sustain or release.
