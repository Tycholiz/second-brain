<p>in situations where there are network effects that are supplied by many different companies, innovation is stymied by the network dependence that manufacturers have on each other</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. in the custom PC industry, the network effects created by different manufacturers having to create an end product that is compatible with other parts creates a gravitational pull that forces manufacturers to continue to make products that follow the standards set out by other companies in the other parts of the supply chain</li>
</ul>
