<p>use a scanner every morning you program to find Stocks in Play based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stocks that in the pre-market gapped up or down at least 2%</li>
<li>Stocks that have traded at least 50,000 shares in the pre-market</li>
<li>Stocks that have an average daily volume of over 500,000 shares</li>
<li>Stocks that have Average True Range of at least 50 cents (how large of a range a stock has on average every day)</li>
<li>There is a fundamental catalyst for the stock</li>
<li>As a rule, I do not trade stocks with an enormous short interest higher than 30% (the short interest is the quantity of stock shares that investors or traders have sold short but not yet covered or closed out)</li>
</ul>
