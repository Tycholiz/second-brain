<p>From brightest to darkest (following circle of fifths), the modes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lydian</li>
<li>Ionian</li>
<li>Mixolydian</li>
<li>Dorian</li>
<li>Aeolian</li>
<li>Phrygian</li>
<li>Locrian</li>
</ul>
<p>each mode has one more lowered interval relative to the tonic than the mode preceding it. Taking Lydian as reference,</p>
<ul>
<li>Ionian (ie. major) has a lowered fourth; </li>
<li>Mixolydian, a lowered fourth and seventh; </li>
<li>Dorian, a lowered fourth, seventh, and third; </li>
<li>Aeolian (ie. natural minor), a lowered fourth, seventh, third, and sixth; </li>
<li>Phrygian, a lowered fourth, seventh, third, sixth, and second;</li>
<li>Locrian, a lowered fourth, seventh, third, sixth, second, and fifth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Put another way, the augmented fourth of the Lydian mode has been reduced to a perfect fourth in Ionian, the major seventh in Ionian to a minor seventh in Mixolydian</p>

<h2 id="dorian">Dorian<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#dorian"></a></h2>
<p>The same as Aeolian (minor), except with a sharpened 6th, making it sound a little bit less dark</p>
<p>A song can be characterized as Dorian by either the notes that are played (basically that characteristic sharpened 6th) or the chords that belong to the Dorian mode.</p>
<p>Dorian is commonly found in funk, where it is more common that Aeolian.</p>

<h2 id="phrygian">Phrygian<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#phrygian"></a></h2>
<p>Phrygian is very similar to Aeolian, with the only difference being a flattened 2nd</p>
<p>Much Flamenco music is in the Phrygian mode, though frequently with the third and seventh degrees raised by a semitone.</p>
<h2 id="lydian">Lydian<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#lydian"></a></h2>
<p>Very similar to Ionian, with the only difference being a sharpened 4th, making a tritone interval with the tonic.</p>
