### Retained Earnings
Retained earnings has little practical significance.
- Retained earnings is not an asset and it certainly is not cash.

### Depreciation
with rare exceptions, business fixed assets are overdepreciatedâ€”not in the actual wearing out or physical using up sense but in the accounting sense.
- the reported book values of a company's fixed assets (original cost less accumulated depreciation) are understated. A company's fixed assets are written off too fast. Book values shrink much quicker than they should.
