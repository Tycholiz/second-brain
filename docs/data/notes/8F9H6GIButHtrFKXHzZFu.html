<p>if you want more authentic responses to a question, just ask the question and don't give any leading answers</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. don't say "how would this solution improve workflow? less swapping back and forth between programs?"</li>
</ul>
<p>"leading the question" like this, adulterated the information the other person has in their head, and influences what their response would be. </p>
<ul>
<li>It's better to just ask the question without any leads, then ask the leads after they have given their response.</li>
</ul>
