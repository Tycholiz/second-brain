New things require new vocabulary. There are two ways to go:
1. You can cut new words from fresh cloth.
2. But more commonly, we adapt existing words for our own purposes, which stand in only the most tenuous relation to the ordinary things referred to by those words.
    - the word “significance” is one of those.
