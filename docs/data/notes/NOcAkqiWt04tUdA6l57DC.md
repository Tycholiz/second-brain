- Similar to how a Sprint team as a retrospective and consider what went well what did go well what were some wins areas of improvement etc.what would happen if you took this concept to your daily life non work. whenever something happens in your life that is significant, you take note of that. Having sex? That's a win. Sharing feelings. Basically they should map to things you want to improve on things you want to be. And if you keep track this information, you can see the gaps. You will see where you need improvement.

When you feel self-righteous about something, it means you are afraid
