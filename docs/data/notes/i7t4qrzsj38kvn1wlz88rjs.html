<h1 id="function">Function<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#function"></a></h1>
<p>A function describes the relationship between a chord and a tonal center, all in the context of the harmonic progression.</p>
<h2 id="tonic-function">Tonic function<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#tonic-function"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>stable chords of a key. </li>
<li>In major: <code>I</code> <code>iii</code> <code>vi</code>. They are stable because their triads (ex. C E G) all contain the key's third scale degree (ex. Here, all C E and G chords contain an E.</li>
<li>In minor: <code>i</code> <code>♭VI⁶</code> <code>♭III</code>
Has 3rd but no 4th</li>
</ul>
<p>The third is the most important note for defining the scale's overall sound (modality)</p>
<h2 id="subdominant-function">Subdominant function<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#subdominant-function"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>bridge chords between other 2 functions. These chords take you away from home rather than lead back home. </li>
<li>In major: <code>ii</code> <code>IV</code>. How these chords feel changes depending on if we are using triads or 7th chords. The IV triad contains the root of the key, giving it a little more stability. Meanwhile, the ii lacks the root, making it sound more adrift. The 7th of that chord happens to be the tonic, giving it more stability</li>
<li>Has 4th but no 7th</li>
<li>Chord contains the tonic note of the mode (c)</li>
</ul>
<p>Common melodic resolutions are 5 -> 1, 2 -> 1, 7 -> 1 </p>
<p>In minor, the 4th is usually a <code>iv⁷</code></p>
<h2 id="dominant-function">Dominant function<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#dominant-function"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>unstable chords that provide tension and point back to tonic. Main engine that drives songs forward. 
<ul>
<li>it is unstable because of the characteristic leading tone</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>in the major scale, if we add a 7th it adds even more instability, thus making it have more gravity in wanting to point back to the tonic (ie. it makes the dominant function of the <code>V</code> scale even more dominant by making it a <code>V⁷</code>)</li>
<li>In major: <code>V</code> <code>vii°</code>. They both contain the 7th (leading tone) and 2nd degree of the scale. These notes circle around the tonic and want to collapse in toward it. </li>
<li>Has 7th but no 3rd</li>
<li>Doesn't really exist in minor, because there is no leading tone in minor, which dominant needs. Harmonic minor scale includes a leading tone, which effectively brings back the leading tone (and by extension the dominant resolution).</li>
</ul>
<p>Playing the V keeps the music from resolving</p>
