## Kids
### Posture
- showed them how to put their hands on the keyboard, not slumping and keeping a 'bubble' under our hands.
- straight back

### Notes
- talked about how notes go up / down. We played high notes and low notes. You can play a game where they close their eyes and you ask them if it's a high note or a low note.
  - I always like to say "OK, now i'm going to try to trick you! See if you can figure it out!" they love that. Then I say "WOW HOW DID YOU KNOW?" Positive reinforcement is very important to the learning process. Show them that they are doing well and you can't believe how good they are doing.

### Hands/Fingers
- Start teaching them right vs left. Ask them to raise right hand, left hand. Play simon says. Turn right, left, stand on right foot, etc etc.
- Begin learning finger numbers, thumb is 1, etc. 
  - it's also fun to have them try to remember in games. wiggle your RH 3, etc. Do these a little bit every day until you think they're ready to move on. Finger numbers are really helpful to talk about.

### Rhythm
Rhythm Games - Hands clapping. Keeping a steady beat. Sound game - fast or slow clapping.
