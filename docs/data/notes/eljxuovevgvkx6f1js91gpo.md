Distorted electric guitar is not normally compressed, since they are basically already compressed
- same with square-waved synths
- note, this does not apply to using a multi-band compressor in order to tone shape, as this solved a different issue altogether

### EQ
Most of the problem frequencies in acoustic guitar are in mid-range (somewhere around 900-1000 hZ)

High frequencies (~8k-10k hZ) are typically undesirable, so it's a good idea to use a high cut filter.

Overdriven guitars benefit from slight boosts (~5-10dB) in the midrange (~1k hZ)

Try cutting the *oomph* sound made by the pick hitting the strings on the downstroke, which typically occurs somewhere between 150-200hZ
- this sound can be seen in the soundwave as the loudest point in the wave, occuring right at the start of the sound.

There's nothing really of value at around 50hZ and below, so cut it all out with a high-pass filter
- you probably won't hear a difference, but this sound may manifest on woofers of different speaker systems.

If guitar sounds a little dull, experiment with:

| instrument      | 40-60Hz | 200-400Hz | 1000-3000Hz | 5000-8000Hz | 10000-12000Hz |
|-----------------|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| Acoustic Guitar |         | -5dB      |             | +3dB        | +2dB          |
| Electric Guitar |         |           | +3dB        |             |               |

### Compression
Acoustic guitar can sometimes do without compression. Only use it as a remedy to some issue.

Use fast attack time if the guitarist is inconsistent with dynamic range (ie. playing loud in some parts and quiet in others)
