<p>The main difference between a Will and a Trust is that the trust will let you transfer assets to beneficiaries when youâ€™re still alive, while a will transfers your assets when you die.</p>

<p>A trust allows you to separate the control and management of an asset from its ownership.</p>
<p>Trusts are used to manage estate taxes, shelter assets from creditors and pass on wealth to future generations.</p>
<ul>
<li>one of the most common uses of a trust is to allow for family income and capital gain splitting. </li>
</ul>
<p>The way that the trust does this is by splitting income amongst lower-income earning family members by way of paying dividends out of a private corporation.</p>
<ul>
<li>spec: is this just for a family trust?</li>
</ul>
<p>a trust is formed when a settlor contributes property to the trust for the person he intends to benefit</p>
<p>The usefulness of a trust is based on the fact that a <code>trustee</code> can hold property on behalf a single beneficiary, or a group of <code>beneficiaries</code>, for their benefit while maintaining control over the property.</p>
<ul>
<li>This can be useful from a tax perspective, as it allows income of the trust to be shared with <code>beneficiaries</code> who may be taxed at a lower rate than the trust while not giving up control over the property.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="parties">Parties<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#parties"></a></h3>
<p>There are 3 parties to a trust:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <code>grantor</code>/<code>settlor</code> - the person who makes the trust and transfers their assets into it. They also set out instructions on how the assets are to be used or managed and who will benefit from the assets</li>
<li>a <code>trustee</code> - the person who manages the assets in the trust on behalf of the <code>beneficiaries</code>. Often the <code>trustee</code> is the same person as the <code>settlor</code>, but upon death the role of <code>trustee</code> goes to someone else.</li>
<li>the <code>beneficiaries</code> - the individuals who receive some type of financial benefit from the trust</li>
</ul>
<p>an individual can be all three parties in the same trust.</p>
<ul>
<li>there may be adverse tax consequences if the settlor is a trustee or beneficiary.</li>
