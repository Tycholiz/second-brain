<p>Suspended chords have no 3rd and either an added 4th (sus4) or added major 2nd (sus2)</p>
<p>Suspended chords allow you to "explore" the bass. </p>
<ul>
<li>That is, try making a piano rhymthm with sus2/sus4/major in the right hand, and move around the bass note to drive the progression.</li>

</ul>
<p>sus chords also work well as arpeggiated sequences, leveraging octaves in the bass and the 3-note sus chord in the treble.</p>
<ul>
<li>also works well with the 3rd added back in.</li>
</ul>
