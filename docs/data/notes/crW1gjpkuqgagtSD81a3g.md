# As the Interviewee
In the event that we end up working together, What would I have to do over the next 12 months for you to look back and think "yes, we've made the right decision"

## Questions
- how self directed is it? are there a lot of meetings?
- What do you dislike most about the job?
- can you tell me about what type of teammate wouldn't fit in to the culture?
- how does the company go about considering, evaluating and implementing employee feedback?
  - (if the previous question was answered affirmatively) tell me about the last change that was implemented based on employee feedback. What kind of impact did it have?
- Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a difficult employee. Explain the situation and how you resolved it.
- what is your management style?. What does a bad day and a good day look like? describe it. paycheck off the table, what keeps you coming back to work each day?
- What does work/life balance mean to the company?

## Things to say
If the interviewer says something where you can see the agenda behind their question, acknowledge that by saying "I see what you are trying to get at with that question. Let me tell you about X which I think will help your understanding".
- This gives you frame control and allows you to guide the discussion

When you are introducing yourself to others, consider omitting how much experience you have. 
- The reason is that you don't want to be defined by how many years you have under your belt. Above average performers can grow faster than the average person, so someone with 4 years of experience could realistically be as good as someone with 6 years of experience. Don't let yourself become defined by sheer time.

### Experience points
each point you make to a potential employer needs to be either one of 2 things:
1. You see a need and devise a solution to solve that need (reactive)
2. Implemented something that produced a strong result (proactive)
