It's not that there are 3 different minor scales; it's that there are 3 variations of the same scale.
- that is, some notes of the minor scale may be changed around to achieve some kind of melodic harmony.
- note: that there are other forms of minor scales too. There's the pentatonic minor, Hungarian minor, Jazz minor, Neapolitan and so on.

## Natural minor (Aeolian)
Chords that sound nice with the scale:
- `min7` (minor 3rd, minor 7th)
  - ex. C-E♭-G-B♭

## Harmonic minor
The major scale features a half-step between the 7th and 8th notes of the scale. This interval has a sort of tension-resolution effect. On the other hand, the natural minor scale doesn't have this same feature, since there is a whole step between the 7th and 8th scale degrees. 

This is why the harmonic minor scale exists: it allows us to add that tension-resolution interval to the minor scale. The only difference between it and the natural minor is the raised 7th.
- As a result, when playing in a minor scale, the 7th is only really sharpened when we are going for that tension-resolution effect.

The only difference from the natural minor is that the 7th is sharpened, giving us a leading tone, making it want to point back to the tonic

Chords that sound nice with the scale:
- `minMaj7` (minor 3rd, major 7th)
  - ex. C Eb G B
  - this can be used as the `i`
  - this works because the chord is formed by the `i`, `iii`, `v` and `vii` degrees of the harmonic minor scale.
- `dim`
  - can be extended by adding a minor 7th (`D°⁷`/`Dmin7♭5`)

## Melodic minor
A problem arises with the harmonic minor: the interval between the 6th and 7th scale degrees is 3 semitones, which is rather large.
- ex. in A harmonic minor, this interval is `F`-`G♯`
- To compensate, we can simply raise the 6th so that the interval is only a major 2nd
  - doing this creates a smoother melody when we are leading towards a tonic. However, when we are moving away from a tonic, the natural minor is typically used.

Characterized by the flat 3rd, sharp 6th and sharp 7th


ques: what's the association between natural minor and Dorian?
