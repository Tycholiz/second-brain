If math is all about abstracting real-life concepts, then category theory is like abstracting the abstraction.

A category is anything that can be represented by a graph or a set of nodes with some arrows in between.
- ex. In programming, the world of values and the world of types are both categories

At its core, Category theory is an abstraction of Sets and Functions, wherein Sets themselves are abstractions of "things that are similarâ€œ and Functions are matching things from one set to things from another set. A Category is an assembly of similar Sets and all possible Functions between these Sets.
