There are only three diminished chords, and each one has 4 inversions. you can take any note in a diminished chord and make that the root... which will give you another inversion

### as a Migration Chord
Diminished chords are commonly used as "migration chords", whereby they will take us from one chord to another

Examples
- Bennie and the Jets at "...that's been known to change the weather"
- All Star - Smash Mouth at "...get your game on, go play"

### as a Line Cliche
They are also used as line cliches, where we start with a more or less "normal" note, and move through a progression by dropping the base tone.
- to the ear, it seems all we are doing is just walking down the bass, but in reality we are creating a chord progression.

Examples
- Life on Mars - David Bowie at the intro, the progression goes `F - Am/E - A°/E♭`

### Diatonic
Although diminished chords appear at the 7th scale degree in the major scale, they are not often used like this.
- the reason is because it's considered to be an incomplete version of the dominant chord.
  - ex. in the key of C major, the 7th scale is a `B°`, and the dominant is a `G⁷`, which contains all the notes of the `B°`.
