<h1 id="key">Key<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#key"></a></h1>
<p>Think of the notes of a key as different pieces of punctuation. The root is like the period, since it brings some sense of finality. The 4th is like a comma, which implies there is more to come.</p>
<p>The 3rd is the most melodic part of the key. To make phrases sound more melodic, give more prominence to the 3rd.</p>
<h2 id="relative-key">Relative key<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#relative-key"></a></h2>
<p>Two keys are relative if they contain all of the same notes</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. C and Am</li>
</ul>
<p>The relative minor is 3 semitones below the tonic of the major scale</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. 3 semitones below the C is A, meaning that the relative minor of C is Am</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="modulation">Modulation<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#modulation"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Also known as key change</li>
</ul>
<p>Modulation to the subdominant key often creates a sense of musical relaxation, as opposed to modulation to the dominant (fifth note of the scale), which increases tension.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. If we are playing in C major, modulation to the subdominant means a key change to F</li>
</ul>
