<p>A complex system can be thought of as having 2 properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>Interdependence between components</li>
<li>Nonlinear outputs - meaning that doubling the inputs doesn’t translate to doubling outputs </li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>ex. Taking twice the amount of medication doesn’t make you feel twice as good; doubling employees doesn’t result in twice as much production; 2 weeks on vacation are not twice as good as 1 week on vacation. </li>
</ul>
<p>In environments like this, simple causal associations are misplaced. </p>
