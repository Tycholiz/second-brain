<p>A derivative is a contract whose value is determined by an underlying entity (e.g. an asset, index price, interest rate, weather).</p>
<ul>
<li>a derivative is therefore not direct ownership in anything</li>
<li>ie. the contract <em>derives</em> its value from the underlying.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Billion Dollars worth of asset backed securities need to have a billion dollars of assets behind then, it's a one for one correlation. For derivatives, the same observation fails. It's said that there is well over a Quadrillion $$ of derivatives out there. In other words, even though the value of a derivative is based on something else, it's not a fixed ratio. Which is what exacerbated the CDO/CMO issue in 2008.</p>

<p>There may also be variations of the above, such as <em>synthetic CDOs</em> and <em>credit default swaps</em>.</p>
<h3 id="synthetic-cdo">Synthetic CDO<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#synthetic-cdo"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A variation of a CDO that generally uses credit default swaps and other derivatives to obtain its investment goals.</li>
<li>Sometimes described as a bet on the performance of other mortgage (or other) products, rather than a real mortgage security.</li>
<li>The value and payment stream of a synthetic CDO is derived not from cash assets, like mortgages or credit card payments – as in the case of a regular or "cash" CDO—but from premiums paying for credit default swap "insurance" on the possibility of default of some defined set of "reference" securities—based on cash assets.
<ul>
<li>The insurance-buying "counterparties" may own the "reference" securities and be managing the risk of their default, or may be speculators who've calculated that the securities will default.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A Synthetic CDO is a derivative, while a traditional CDO is not.</p>
<p>The raw material of a traditional CDO is a mortgage. Synthetics are cheaper and easier to create than traditional CDOs when the mortgage market dries up.</p>
<p>Synthetic CDOs are controversial because of their role in the subprime mortgage crisis. They enabled large wagers to be made on the value of mortgage-related securities, which critics argued may have contributed to lower lending standards and fraud</p>
<ul>
<li>as of 2012, the notional value of synthetics was only around $2B, compared to $5T in 2006.</li>
</ul>
