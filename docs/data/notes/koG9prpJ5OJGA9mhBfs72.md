Doubling the length of each side of a square will produce a square that is 4x bigger. This is because a square is a 2-dimensional object, and we are doubling the sides (2²). Similarly, if we double the radius of a sphere, it's volume scales by 8x, since it is in 3-dimensional space (2³)

### Unit conversion of area
A common mistake is to think that $1 km^2 = 1,000 m^2$
- in fact, $1 km^2 = 1,000,000 m^2$
