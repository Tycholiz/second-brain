Any recent salient event is a candidate to become the kernel of a causal narrative.

Persuasive narratives are not ego-centric. If you want to persuade someone that it doesn't reflect poorly on you that you were fired, then you have to be careful about putting yourself at the center of the story, because it might make you look pitiful. Instead, focus on what the company was doing, and particularly on the moral implications of what it was doing. It is easier for your listener to sympathize with your perspective if they agree with the morals that you stood up for.
