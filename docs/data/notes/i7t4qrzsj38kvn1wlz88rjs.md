A function describes the relationship between a chord and a tonal center, all in the context of the harmonic progression.

## Tonic function
- stable chords of a key. 
- In major: `I` `iii` `vi`. They are stable because their triads (ex. C E G) all contain the key's third scale degree (ex. Here, all C E and G chords contain an E.
- In minor: `i` `♭VI⁶` `♭III`
Has 3rd but no 4th

The third is the most important note for defining the scale's overall sound (modality)

## Subdominant function
- bridge chords between other 2 functions. These chords take you away from home rather than lead back home. 
- In major: `ii` `IV`. How these chords feel changes depending on if we are using triads or 7th chords. The IV triad contains the root of the key, giving it a little more stability. Meanwhile, the ii lacks the root, making it sound more adrift. The 7th of that chord happens to be the tonic, giving it more stability
- Has 4th but no 7th
- Chord contains the tonic note of the mode (c)

Common melodic resolutions are 5 -> 1, 2 -> 1, 7 -> 1 

In minor, the 4th is usually a `iv⁷`

## Dominant function
- unstable chords that provide tension and point back to tonic. Main engine that drives songs forward. 
    - it is unstable because of the characteristic leading tone
- in the major scale, if we add a 7th it adds even more instability, thus making it have more gravity in wanting to point back to the tonic (ie. it makes the dominant function of the `V` scale even more dominant by making it a `V⁷`)
- In major: `V` `vii°`. They both contain the 7th (leading tone) and 2nd degree of the scale. These notes circle around the tonic and want to collapse in toward it. 
- Has 7th but no 3rd
- Doesn't really exist in minor, because there is no leading tone in minor, which dominant needs. Harmonic minor scale includes a leading tone, which effectively brings back the leading tone (and by extension the dominant resolution).

Playing the V keeps the music from resolving
