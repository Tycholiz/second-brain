<p>When you draw down on your RRSP (ie. withdraw money from it), you lose the contribution room of the amount removed.</p>
<p>The max deduction limit is 18% of gross income previous year, up to $27,830</p>
<p>You donâ€™t have to deduct an RRSP contribution on your tax return in the same year you make the contribution. You can wait and deduct it in a future year. You may choose to do this if you think your income will be higher in the future, moving you up to a higher tax bracket. This is called having unused RRSP contributions.</p>
<p>Employer's contributions to the RRSP are able to be included as part of the RRSP contributions deduction.</p>
<p>RRSP deadline is March 1 2023.</p>
<p>Contribution room can be obtained from CRA Notice of Assessment (check mail within CRA portal)</p>
