“Algebra” means, roughly, “relationships”

### Quadratic functions (ie. second degree polynomial)
Anything that follows the shape of a parabola can be expressed as a quadratic function'
- ex. tossing a ball into the air can be expressed as a parabola, where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is height

A quadratic function is just a mapping between an input set of numbers and an output set of numbers.
- ex. $10x^2 + 25x + 10$
