Carbon is so necessary to life due to its remarkable capacity for forming chains and rings and other complex molecular architectures.

Carbon enters the food web via photosynthesis when plants extract it from CO2 in the atmosphere. 
- All the carbon in the atmosphere ultimately comes from plants, and it is continually being recycled back into the atmosphere when we breathe out and die.

Most of the carbon in the atmosphere's carbon dioxide is carbon-12, which is not radioactive. However, 1 out of every trillion carbon atoms is carbon-14, which *is* radioactive.
- carbon-14 has a [[half-life|science.chemistry.atoms.isotopes#half-life]] of 5730 years, and it decays to nitrogen-14.
- plant biochemistry doesn't care if it's getting carbon-12 or carbon-14.

The clock of carbon 14 is "zeroed" at the time that an organism dies as the inflow of fresh carbon 14 is cut off

The ratio of carbon 14 to carbon 12 in living things is the same as whatâ€™s found in the atmosphere. Once an organism dies, the carbon 14 starts to decay to nitrogen 14 and thus the ratio changes. Eventually, the only carbon left will be carbon 12 (more accurately, the carbon 14 will become too small to measure)
- therefore, the ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 14 can be used to calculate the time that has elapsed since the death of an organism

Carbon dating is only accurate to the nearest century or so
