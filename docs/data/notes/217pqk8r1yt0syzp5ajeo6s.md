## Mental Division Tricks
- divide by 5: multiply the number by 2 and remove a zero.

## Mental trick: Divisibility
### Divisible by 3 and 9
Sum up all the digits, and if that number is divisible by 3, then so is the original number
- ex. "is 231 divisible by 3?" can be restated as "is 6 (2+3+1) divisible by 3?"
- ex. "is 375 divisible by 9?" can be restataed as "is 15 divisible by 9?

### Divisible by 6
Sum up all digits, and if that number is divisible by 3 *AND* is an even number, then the original number is divisible by 6

### Divisible by 4
If the last 2 digits of a number are divisible by 4, then so is the whole number
- ex. "is 43,275 divisible by 4?" can be restated as "is 75 divisible by 4?"

#### A big 2-digit number
We can figure out if a big 2-digit number is divisible by 4 by taking the first digit, doubling it, then adding the second digit
- ex. "is 96 divisible by 4?" can be restated as "is 24  divisible by 4?
    - $(9*2) + 6 = 24$

### Divisible by 8
Take the last 3 digits of the number and multiple the 100's column digit by $4$, the 10's column digit by $2$, and the 1's column digit by $1$, and sum the results.
- ex. 362,848: 
$$
(4 x 8) + (2 x 4) + 8 = 48
$$

48 is divisible by 8, therefore 362,848 is divisible by 8
