<p>For a story to be talkable, it has to be three things: relevant, interesting, and authentic.</p>
<p>Your first job is to separate all of your marketing efforts into two piles. In the first pile are things that people might talk about. Not just what someone will notice and maybe even act on, but what might actually spur a conversation between people. In the second pile goes everything else.</p>
<p>You won’t get good at word of mouth marketing until you really understand what motivates people to talk about the stuff they talk about.</p>
<p>Before you run an ad, before you launch a product, before you put something new on the menu, ask the magic question: Would anyone tell a friend about this?</p>
<p>Once you’ve got your big word of mouth idea, find a bunch of ways to make it easier to spread.</p>
<p>We want to hear from someone with the same needs and lifestyle that we have.</p>
<p>Ideas spread most reliably when they piggyback off an existing network of closely connected and interested people.</p>
<ul>
<li>In other words, if you’re trying to attract groups, find common points of origin.</li>
</ul>
<p>if you want your customers to remember you, do something remarkable and unexpected</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. When I took my vacuum cleaner to get it repaired, the repairman opened up the dust repository and dumped it right there on his floor, creating a big mess. This was unexpected that he'd done that, as you'd expect someone emptying a vacuum dust repository to do it over a garbage can. This stuck in my mind as remarkable, and I think of this event from time to time.</li>
