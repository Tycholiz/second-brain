# Running a sample
1. start with a focused problem definition. What are you trying to figure out?
	- from this definition, we can derive what our population even looks like
	- ex. A population can be defined as including all people or items with the characteristic one wishes to understand
	
### Stratified sampling
- dividing your sample into meaninful groups
- ex. in taking a sample of the population to get political sentiment, it makes sense to stratify the sample into political party, age groups, ethnicity etc
