<p>There is a difference between the "skills" of bullshitting and lying. Bullshitting involves making up and stretching truths in the moment. When someone catches you in a lie, if you are a good bullshitter, then you are able to explain your way through it. On the other hand, lying involves keeping a secret, and upholding the alternative worldview that you wish to project onto everyone else. In these cases, bullshitting might be the same as <em>explaining your way</em> out of a problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot assume that just because someone is a good liar, that they are a good bullshitter also. A good bullshitter can get caught in a discrepancy in what they said, and can explain it away.</li>
