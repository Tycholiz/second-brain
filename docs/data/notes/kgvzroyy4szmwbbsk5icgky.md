### One-on-ones (1:1)
start off by asking “how are you doing?” because it’s one of the many questions people forget to ask when the day-to-day gets overwhelming. Stopping for a few minutes to discuss how we’re feeling is a prerequisite to feeling appreciated and heard.

#### First one-on-one
- What do you like to do outside of work?
- What are your 1 year, 3-year, and 5-year career goals?

#### Recurring
- What has been the highlight of your past week? Lowlight?
- What kind of things have you been working on?
- What kind of challenges are you facing? Does anything feel harder than it should be?
