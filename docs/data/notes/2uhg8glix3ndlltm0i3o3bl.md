- clean up noise on tracks

## Analysis
- Goniometer: shows us the visualization of the sound, giving us a view of its stereo width and how big the sound is
    - this is good for visualizing before+after an effect is applied (such as delay, reverb, compression)
- s(M)exoscope: shows us the soundwave (including after all FX have been applied)
    - this good for visualizing how a certain effect modifies a soundwave (e.g. what compression does to a soundwave)
- SPAN: shows us a visualization of the whole frequency range
    - this is good to put on the master track to see the spread of frequencies across the whole song. We can solo certain frequency bands (similar to what you can do with an EQ) to get a feel for where certain sound elements are coming from (e.g. boominess, muddiness, brightness)
