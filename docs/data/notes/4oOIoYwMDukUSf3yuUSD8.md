When you want someone to perform a task that is rather difficult, overstate the importance/difficulty of the project.
- ex. Don't say "You have to do this by Friday at two P.M.", but say "I need the impossible done by Friday at two P.M. Can you do it?"
- This causes the person to feel that they have a responsibility to work hard for themselves. they are not doing it because they were told, but because they decided to undertake the challenge on their own.

if people aren’t aware of their genius, they are not in a position to deliberately utilize it. By telling people what you see, you can raise their awareness and confidence, allowing them to provide their capability more fully.

make it clear to each person why she has been selected for that role. Don't only notice their talent; label it for them.

begin with small, early wins and use those to generate belief toward the greater stretch challenges.

your greatest contribution might depend on your ability to ask the right question, not have the right answer. You will see that all great thinking starts with a provocative question and a rich debate

In terms of inspiring people, your energy is more essential than your message.
