<ul>
<li>Lag measure - a measure of the thing you are ultimately trying to improve. This is the metric that tells you if you've actually achieved the goal. Called <em>lag</em> because by the time you see them, the action taken to achieve those goals has already passed. You see it <em>after</em> the fact
<ul>
<li>Difficult to use for growth, since the data comes when it's too late.</li>
<li>Cannot be directly influenced, since it has already happened.</li>
<li>Can be tempting to focus on, since they are easier to measure, and they represent the result we ultimately want.</li>
<li><strong><em>ex.</em></strong> - weight loss, revenue growth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lead measure - Tells you if you are likely to achieve the goal. These are the metrics that serve as predictors of success
<ul>
<li><strong><em>ex.</em></strong> - eating healthy and exercising <em>predict</em> a healthy body and mind, while tracking weight is too detached from the actions that lead to being healthy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>analogy</em></strong> lead/lag indicators in economics</li>
