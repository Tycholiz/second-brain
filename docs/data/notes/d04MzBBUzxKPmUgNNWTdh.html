<p>The software field is an ocean, with new technologies coming out constantly. With these new technologies coming out, it inevitably results in other software becoming stale and out of date.</p>
<ul>
<li>"how do you go about hitching your wagon to technology that will more stand the test of time?"</li>
</ul>
<p>What is your approach to learning a new technology?</p>
<ul>
<li>"Imagine you joined a company where you knew about half of the tech stack. How would you grapple with that reality that you are going to feel uncomfortable? How do you overcome that discomfort, and increase your competency level</li>
</ul>
<p>How do you combat arrogance? how do you stay humble in a field whose lifeblood seems to be opinionatedness and getting your way due to your convictions.</p>
<p>talk me through a previous project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give an overview of the system</li>
<li>What tech stack did you use?</li>
<li>What are the standard idioms for that stack?</li>
<li>How did you structure your system?</li>
<li>Did you find that easy to change?</li>
<li>What engineering techniques enabled change?</li>
<li>What problems stand out in your mind? How did you solve them?</li>
<li>How did you test this?</li>
<li>How was work divided across the team?</li>
<li>What would you change if you did it again?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ui">UI<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#ui"></a></h2>
<p>imagine you are implementing a particular component based on the ui designs. how do you strike a balance between making something pixel perfect to the way a design is, given that there are often minor crucial details that designers are often unaware of</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. Designer creates a component <code>Calendar</code>, but as you are building it, you come aware that it would take a long time to implement the custom colors that the UI designer has shown. How do you approach</li>
</ul>

<p>Tech interview problem to assess thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>take a simple app (such as a <a href="https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld">RealWorld</a> app), break something in it (say, break it so that there is an error when you try to submit a new post). Show the candidate that it is not working, then get out of their way to see how they go about solving the problem.</li>
</ul>
