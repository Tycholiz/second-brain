Suspended chords have no 3rd and either an added 4th (sus4) or added major 2nd (sus2)

Suspended chords allow you to "explore" the bass. 
- That is, try making a piano rhymthm with sus2/sus4/major in the right hand, and move around the bass note to drive the progression.

sus chords also work well as arpeggiated sequences, leveraging octaves in the bass and the 3-note sus chord in the treble.
- also works well with the 3rd added back in.
