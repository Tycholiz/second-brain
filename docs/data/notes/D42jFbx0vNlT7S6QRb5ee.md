"great creators don’t necessarily have the deepest expertise but rather seek out the broadest perspectives."

when it comes to idea generation, quantity is the most predictable path to quality. “Original thinkers,” Stanford professor Robert Sutton notes, “will come up with many ideas that are strange mutations, dead ends, and utter failures. The cost is worthwhile because they also generate a larger pool of ideas—especially novel ideas.”

It is when people have moderate expertise in a particular domain that they’re the most open to radically creative ideas.

When you’ve spent years studying one domain, intuition can beat analysis, because your unconscious mind excels at pattern recognition.
