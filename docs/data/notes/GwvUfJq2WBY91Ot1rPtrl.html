<h1 id="candle-stick">Candle Stick<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#candle-stick"></a></h1>
<p>Each "candlestick" typically shows one day</p>
<p>each candlestick represents all four important pieces of information for that day:
1/2. open and close in the thick body; </p>
<ul>
<li>whether the top or bottom indicates open or close depends on the color of the candlestick.
3/4 high and low in the “candle wick”</li>
</ul>

<p>If the asset closed higher than it opened, the body is hollow or unfilled, with the opening price at the bottom of the body and the closing price at the top. If the asset closed lower than it opened, the body is solid or filled, with the opening price at the top and the closing price at the bottom.</p>
<p>Generally, the longer the body of the candle, the more intense the trading.</p>
