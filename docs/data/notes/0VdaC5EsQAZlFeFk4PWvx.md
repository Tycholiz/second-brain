*Affirming the consequent* is a logical fallacy confusing the directionality of if-then propositions. Logic is sometimes bi-directional, but it is the exception, not the rule.
- This is related to the fallacy of not recognizing the difference between "all **X** are **Y**" and "all **Y** are **X**".
    - ex. claiming "most terrorists are muslim" is not the same as claiming "most muslims are terrorists"
- Statistical equivalent of *confusion of the inverse*
    - ***ex.*** - If most criminals are members of group X, most members of group X must be criminals.
- ***ex.***
    - **P**: If X, then Y.
    - **C**: If Y, then X.
    *or*
    - **P1**: If X, then Y.
    - **P2**: Y.
    - **C**: X.
