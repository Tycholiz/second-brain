<ul>
<li>helps to understand a stock's performance in relation to the risk it has had</li>
<li>Drawbacks are:
<ol>
<li>uses SD, meaning we are assuming that the returns are normally distributed
<ul>

<li>the value tells us how much the excess return it has had, in relation to the volatility it has endured (some might call risk).
<ul>

<li>The volatility considered in terms of âˆ†Standard Deviation of Excess return (ie. "how much more volatile is this stock than the market?")</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Risk premium = how much percentage <em>over</em> the market rate the stock is expected to return (ie. <code>expected return - risk-free rate</code>)</li>
