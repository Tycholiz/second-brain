It’s better to write each part separately – your arrangement will sound more like a living string ensemble.
- Each line should be able to stand alone.
- Rather than writing a series of block chords where everyone changes note at the beginning of the bar, introduce independent melodic movement. You give the player a chance to add expression. It varies the ensemble sound and helps the music breathe and come to life.

Don’t forget that a small string ensemble can be forcefully percussive as well as lyrically melodic.

there’s a lot of overlap between instruments. 
- The viola, which is pitched a fifth lower than the violin, can sound great higher up within the lower violin range
- all 5 instruments are capable of covering the G3-G4 register.

### Violin
*"brilliant"*

Violin1 usually plays higher notes than violin2

### Viola
*"biting and nasal"*

### Cello
*"chest voice"*

Try giving the melody to the Cello, and giving the bass line to the viola

### Double Bass
*"penetrating"*

Usually the double bass will get either the same notes as the cello but down an octave, or otherwise have a pretty simple bass line while the other string instruments bring in the complexity.
