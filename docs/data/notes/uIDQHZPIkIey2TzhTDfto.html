<p>An estate is the net worth of an individual at any given point of time, whether alive or dead.</p>

<p>2 areas where estate is most relevant:</p>
<ul>
<li>bankruptcy - a trustee is appointed to distribute your assets to creditors</li>
<li>death - a trustee is appointed by you to distribute your assets to your heirs</li>
</ul>
<p>Canadians don’t have to contend with an estate tax the way U.S. citizens do. However, what many people don’t realize is that a “deemed disposition tax” applies when you die.</p>
<ul>
<li>The deemed disposition tax is so named because your investments are deemed to be sold at death. Any capital gains triggered by their sale are included in a final income tax return filed in the year of your death.</li>
<li>A final tax return also includes the value of any retirement accounts and income received from stocks, bonds, real estate investments, and even life insurance proceeds in the year of death</li>
</ul>
<p>tax is deferred if the assets are transferred to a surviving spouse</p>
<ul>
<li>When the spouse dies, and the assets are passed on to other heirs, 50% of the capital gains of any stocks, bonds, real estate investments, and other assets are taxable at the personal income tax rate.</li>
</ul>
