$$
Force = mass * acceleration
$$
- this formula shows us that as the mass of an object increases, the force required to move it at the same acceleration has to increase.
- this idea that mass resists acceleration is called *inertia*.
- inertia means the object wants to continue to do what it does.
    - ex. if it is at rest (in relation to us), it continues to be at rest. If it is moving East at 20 m/s, it continues moving East at 20 m/s. etc.
