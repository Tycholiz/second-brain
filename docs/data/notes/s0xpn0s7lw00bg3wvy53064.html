<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#what-is-it"></a></h2>
<p>The envelope of a sound is the journey that the sound takes from its inception to its ultimate completion. In other words, it describes how a sound changes over time.</p>
<ul>
<li>there are various types of envelope
<ul>
<li>ex. an amplitude envelope describes how the amplitude of a sound changes over time
<ul>
<li>amp envelopes are most common, particularly when talking about acoustic (ie. non-digital) sounds</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>consider the plucking of a guitar string. As we hit the string, the sound reaches its absolute peak.</p>
<p>Instruments don't make sounds the way lamps make light: it's not "all" or "nothing."</p>
<ul>
<li>instead, the sound wave is composed of 4 sections:

</ul>
<h2 id="adsr">ADSR<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#adsr"></a></h2>
<p>The combination of ADSR describe how a sound changes over time.</p>
<h3 id="attack">Attack<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#attack"></a></h3>
<p>The attack controls the time taken for the sound to reach its peak from nil.</p>
<ul>
<li>in the case of an amplitude envelope, it is the part of the envelope where amplitude is still increasing. 
<ul>
<li>In other words, it is the time taken for amplitude to reach max level.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most natural instruments have a very short attack, meaning they reach max amplitude very quickly.</p>
<p>A slow attack can be perceived as a sort of fade-inâ€” as we press the key down, it takes a more significant amount of time before the sound reaches its peak amplitude.</p>
<h3 id="decay">Decay<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#decay"></a></h3>
<p>The decay controls the time taken for the envelope to decrease from its peak to the sustain level. </p>
<ul>
<li>in the case of an amplitude envelope, the part where amplitude starts to decrease. This phase starts as soon as the attack phase reaches its peak.</li>
<li>in real spaces high frequencies often decay quite fast while bass frequencies stick around much longer. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sustain">Sustain<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#sustain"></a></h3>
<p>the period during which amplitude remains constant</p>
<ul>
<li>many natural instruments (e.g. guitar) don't have a sustain phase</li>
</ul>
<p>While attack, decay, and release refer to a length of time, sustain refers to level (e.g. in case of amp envelope, a volume level).</p>
<ul>
<li>often, sustain is quantified by a % of the peak value
<ul>
<li>ex. with an amplitude envelope, a sustain of 70% means that the sustain phase of the envelope is at 70% of the amplitude of the peak's amplitude value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="release">Release<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#release"></a></h3>
<p>the final reduction in amplitude.</p>
<p>On piano, this would be the time it takes for the sound to reach 0 amplitude after we take our finger off the key.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="example-envelopes-of-different-instruments">Example: envelopes of different instruments<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#example-envelopes-of-different-instruments"></a></h3>
<p>ex. If you press a piano key and release it, the sound changes volume gradually over time. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, it rises quickly (or "attacks") to its maximum volume. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, the sound "decays" to a lower level and stays there or "sustains." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, when we let go of the key, the sound "releases" and dies down to silence. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a piano, the attack phase is fairly slow and the sustain phase can be really long as the notes take a long time to die away. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ex. With a flute, the attack phase is quicker and sharper, there is little decay, the sustain continues for as long as the flautist keeps blowing, and the release is also very fast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ex. With the strike of a drum, you have an almost instant attack, a longer decay (depending on what material you're hitting), and effectively no sustain or release.</p>
</li>
</ul>
