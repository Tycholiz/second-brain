<p>If math is all about abstracting real-life concepts, then category theory is like abstracting the abstraction.</p>
<p>A category is anything that can be represented by a graph or a set of nodes with some arrows in between.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. In programming, the world of values and the world of types are both categories</li>
</ul>
<p>At its core, Category theory is an abstraction of Sets and Functions, wherein Sets themselves are abstractions of "things that are similarâ€œ and Functions are matching things from one set to things from another set. A Category is an assembly of similar Sets and all possible Functions between these Sets.</p>
