The CPI either understates or overstates cost-of-living increases.
- known as the index number problem.

The CPI is supposed to represent the average Canadian household's spending habits. For this reason, a weighted average is used.
- ex. Canadians spend approximately 16% of their household budget on Food, (which further breaks down in other categories), 27% on Shelter, and 19% on Transportation, etc. This overall level of our spending is factored into the calculation of the CPI.
    - This shows how it is inherent in the model of the CPI that we are talking about averages here. There is no single individual that exists that will pay *exactly* 5% more from last year if CPI is 5%. What results is a bell curve, and each individual may reside on either side of that average.

The CPI also breaks down how much weight each province is given in the calculation.
- ex. Ontario carries an expenditure share of 39.83%, which means that consumption in Ontario represents 39.83% of all household consumer spending in Canada
- ex. British Columbians contribute more to overall consumer spending than Yukoners, so the changing prices in B.C. will be given more consideration.

If the province's consumer expenditure on a particular commodity is negligible, then it may be withheld from the calculation
- ex. The average Albertan's yearly expenditure on fuel is so low that it isn't even included in their CPI calculation.

### Base period
The CPI is arbitrarily set to equal 100 in the index base period.
- meaning all index values express price change in percentage terms in comparison to the index base period
- ex. if the index is 123.4, that means prices have increased 23.4% since the base period. As of 2021, the index base period of the CPI is 2002.
