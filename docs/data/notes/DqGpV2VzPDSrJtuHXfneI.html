<ul>
<li>explain what a pomelo is in 2 ways: 
<ol>
<li>A pomelo is the largest citrus fruit. The rind is very thick but soft and easy to peel away. The resulting fruit has a light yellow to coral pink flesh and can vary from juicy to slightly dry and from seductively spicy- sweet to tangy and tart</li>
<li>A pomelo is basically a super sized grapefruit with a very thick and soft rind</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>which do you know more about?</li>
<li>the second explanation is stickier because we have used our existing grapefruit schema to help understand a new concept</li>
<li>this is analogous to object-oriented programming, in the sense that a grapefruit inherit certain properties, such as tanginess, citrus, acidic etc. When we say something is like a grapefruit, then that object we are describing inherits all of these properties, plus all of the ones that we specify afterwards. (Ex. It is like uber for hotels)</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>the most basic way to get someone's attention is to break a pattern</p>
<ul>
<li>humans adapt quickly to consistent patterns. Consistent and predictable patterns cause us to tune out</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Percentages are easier to understand than big numbers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use intuitive concepts when possible</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. "...costs as much as a b-2 bomber" is not as relatable as "...costs as much as one soft drink per month"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
