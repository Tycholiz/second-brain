### Perfect Fourth
All you need is love brass intro
- this is not exactly true. you have to imagine that the first 2 notes are unison, rather than ascending

### Tritone
Examples
- Simpsons choral intro + bass line
- YYZ

### Perfect 5th
Examples
- Star Wars
- Twinkle Twinkle Little Star

### Minor 6th
The minor 6th is the 5th of the tonic's tritone, making it a dissonant interval

Examples
- Baker street saxophone
- Usher - Yeah! (the first duo is 1-6, then it's 1-6)

The James bond theme (chordal intro, not the riff) is good for recognizing both the minor sixth and major sixth intervals. It starts at a fifth, then ascends to minor 6th then major, then back down.

### Major 6th
Examples:
- Two of us (intro) - Beatles
- Goron Lullaby (1st and 3rd note; skip out the intervening note)
  - Goron Lullaby is 1-5-6

Descending:
- Man in the Mirror - Michael Jackson
  - "*I'm start*ing with the man in the mirror"

### Minor 7th
Can't stop - Red hot chilli peppers

### Major 7th
Examples
- Take on me (during the part where he sings "take on me")

### Octave
Examples
- Starman (David Bowie; Chorus)
