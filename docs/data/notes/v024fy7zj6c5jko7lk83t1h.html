<p>As a general rule, when an instrument just doesn’t work by itself, pair it with another instrument to perform the same melody, and pan it similarly.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. Take me to the pilot does a good job of this with 2 different string parts playing the same hook melody. It thickens out the sound and makes it more believable</li>
<li>So if you have a lead melody part, always ask: is this instrument doing justice to it, or does it perhaps need a hand pushing the melody?</li>
</ul>

<p>"phase" describes how in-sync soundwaves are with each other.</p>
<ul>
<li>how off-set the waves are with each other can be described in degrees
<ul>
<li>0° means perfectly in phase; 180° means out of phase.
<ul>
<li>when out of phase, the 2 soundwaves will cancel when mixed together, making no sound (<em>"phase cancellation"</em>).</li>
<li>when in phase, the 2 soundwaves will reinforce each other and the result will be louder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>The phase cancellation between two signals matters more for lower freqency sounds.</p>

<p>To avoid phase cancellation, Microphones should never be within 3x the distance that the microphone is from the sound source. </p>
<ul>
<li>ex. If we have a microphone 1 foot away from the strings of a piano, any additional microphones should be at least 3 feet away from the first microphone.</li>
<li>note: this seems to be contradicted by the Reddit explanation above, so take it with a grain of salt</li>
