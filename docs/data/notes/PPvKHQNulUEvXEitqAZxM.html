<h1 id="respect">Respect<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#respect"></a></h1>
<p>People confuse courtesy with respect.  Everyone deserves courtesy, respect is earned.</p>
<p>think of respect as a currency with a value. When you give everyone respect, you are inflating that currency and making that respect less valuable</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. think of how few times John Lennon publicly recognized Paul's work. This makes it so when Paul writes a hit song and John praises it, that praise is elevated in value </li>
