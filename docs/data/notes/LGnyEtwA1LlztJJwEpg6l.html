<p>Life Is Like Running Your Own Marathon. Some start fast. Some start slow. The person who sprinted in the beginning might lose steam quickly and fall behind. Another one who was slow at first might pick up the speed eventually and passes all others who ran ahead of her. Just because your friends seem to be ahead of you, that doesn't mean it will stay that way.
We are NOT running a race that everyone competes against each other, but are running our OWN individual marathon</p>
<p>Success is intoxicating, yet to sustain it requires sobriety.</p>
