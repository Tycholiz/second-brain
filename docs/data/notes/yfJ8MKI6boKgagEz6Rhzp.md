# Verbal fluency
- Achieved when *cognitive load* is minimized and *working memory* is maximized.

## Decreasing cognitive load
- eliminate distractions. Get in the zone where it is just you and your audience.
- Keep your emotions in check. When you feel insulted, you are overloading your
    cognition and it leaves you unable to think straight anymore.

# Speech Philosophies
## Empowerment promise
- starting off your talk with a bold promise
- ex. by the end of the 60-minute talk you will know things about learning that you never knew before, some of what you incorporate into your daily life

## use cycles
- circle back to your main theme at least 3 times.
- reason: people zone out. this cements it in their mind

## build a fence
- build a fence around your ideas, distinguishing them from other ideas that may be confused with your own.
- ex. "it sounds similar to this other idea, but the distinguishing factor is..."
