- In order to get clients and/or employees to get work done faster for you, use verbiage such as "how many hours do you see this taking?", rather than "when could you get it done?", or "how long would it take?". The difference is subtle, but this way, if you already have an idea of their current workload, you should be in a better position to say "ok so 20 hours, and with your current workload we should be able to get it in a couple of weeks."
    - In this way, we retain power when setting goals and deadlines as we guide them into giving us the more realistic forecast of time it will take.
