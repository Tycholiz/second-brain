## Ratios in music
Music is all about ratios

The choice of 12 semitones per octave comes from the fact that going up 12 "perfect fifths" (3:2 ratio) is almost exactly the same as going up 7 octaves (2:1 ratio)
- the chromatic semitones are equally spaced by have each note be the same ratio higher than the preceding note, so that the product of 12 of these ratios equals 2:1 (octave) exactly. 
  - Mathematically this ratio is the twelfth root of 2.

## Tonic
Music is built around the tonic. Some notes are ok with being away from the tonic, but others give a strong push towards ending up at a tonic. Notably, the leading tone of a scale wants to point back to the tonic. If the tonic is the most grounded note of the spectrum, then the leading tones serve to add gravity to the music. That is, they send the progression back to the tonic center.

## Metronome
The goal of playing with a metronome is not to rely on it, it's to develop your internal sense of space and time
- try setting your metronome on beats 2 & 4, which forms the backbeat of most popular music. Then, try setting it only on beat 4. Then try putting it on the "and" of beat 4. Then try putting it on the first beat of every second bar. Doing this allows you to really feel the space between the beats and how the music fits in it.

The root of the relative minor is 3 semi tones below the root of the relative major
- ***ex.*** A minor is relative minor of C major because A is 3 semi tones below C

Plagal cadence - when IV (subdominant) chord resolves to the I (tonic)
