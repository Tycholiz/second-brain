<li>paywalls are hostile. Sites that bar access to their content unless you remove the adblock are also aggressive. A more effective strategy would be to let them use your content uninterrupted for several sessions, then ask the person in a modal upon entry to the website if they will support our content, in the event that it has added value to them. They can choose to turn the ad block off and support us that way, or pay a certain amount to keep the ads off ($10/month)</li>
