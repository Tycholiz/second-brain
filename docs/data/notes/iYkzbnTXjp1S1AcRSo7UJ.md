An inverse function undoes the operation of the original function.
- that is, the inverse function of a function f (also called the inverse of f) is a function that undoes the operation of f.

ex. imagine we have a function
$$
f(x) = 5x âˆ’ 7
$$

One can think of $f$ as "the function which multiplies its input by 5 then subtracts 7 from the result". To undo this, one adds 7 to the input, then divides the result by 5.

Therefore, the inverse is
$$
f(y) = (y + 7)/5
$$

### Celsius-Fahrenheit
Consider that the inverse of the formula to calculate C to F is the same formula to calculate F to C.
$$
f(C) = {9\over5C} + 32
$$
$$
f(F) = {5\over9}(F - 32)
$$

Therefore, `f(F)` is the inverse of `f(C)`, and `f(C)` is the inverse of `f(F)`
