if you want more authentic responses to a question, just ask the question and don't give any leading answers
- ex. don't say "how would this solution improve workflow? less swapping back and forth between programs?"

"leading the question" like this, adulterated the information the other person has in their head, and influences what their response would be. 
- It's better to just ask the question without any leads, then ask the leads after they have given their response.
