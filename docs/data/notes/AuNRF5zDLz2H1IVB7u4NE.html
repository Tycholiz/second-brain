<p>Loss aversion - It is difficult to get people to accept losses. That's why it's better to negotiate by getting the other party to give you something, rather than having them give up something</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. It feels better to gain $50 twice than $100 once, since every gain is rewarding. Likewise, it feels worse to lose $50 twice than to lose $100 once, since every loss is painful.</li>
</ul>
