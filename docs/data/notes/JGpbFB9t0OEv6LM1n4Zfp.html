<p>When writing to someone, write as if you are speaking it. Written language =/= spoken language, because it is more complex and takes more energy to understand. If you want people to read </p>
<p>be more directed in your questions/comments to people. For instance: if you are looking to a specific answer to a question, ask in a way that is not open to interpretation, and answers your appetite for asking the question in the first place. This seems obvious, but consider that we do it often. </p>
<ul>
<li>ex. asking someone "is it worth it to use firebase?" well, it depends, doesn't it? The person now needs to learn more about you.  A more effective <em>and</em> efficient way to get the desired answer out of this is to be more pointed "when would you NOT want to use Firebase?" See how this is immediately understood? It's pointed and specific.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure your opening email contains no more than two Is and MEs.</p>
