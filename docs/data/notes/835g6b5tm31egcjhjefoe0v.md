When we play chords in different inversions, we are *voicing* the same chord differently.

### Root Position
- The *basic* way of playing a chord is known as *root position* (e.g. a `Cmaj` chord is `CEG`)

### 1st Inversion
- 1st inversion is when we remove the tonic and replace it an octave above
  - therefore, the lowest note is the 3rd

### 2nd Inversion
- 2nd inversion is when (from 1st inversion), we remove the third and replace it an octave above
  - therefore, the lowest note is the 5th

In this inversion, the bass note (the fifth) and the root of the chord are a fourth apart which traditionally qualifies as a dissonance.

### 3rd Inversion
- Since 7th chords have 4 notes, there is a 3rd inversion (which doesn't exist in basic triads)
