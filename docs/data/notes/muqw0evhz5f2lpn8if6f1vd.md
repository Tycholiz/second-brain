# $\cup$
The union of two sets is the set consisting of elements from *any* of the sets.
- in other words, the union set is composed of elements that exist in at least one of its constituent sets.
- ex. if $A = \{1, 3, 5, 7\}$ and $B = \{1, 2, 4, 6, 7\}$, then $A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$

### Example: Yelp
- $A =$ The set of Yelp users who like Biz1
- $B =$ The set of Yelp users who like Biz2

The set $A \cup B$ is the set of users that liked either Biz1 or Biz2 (or both)
