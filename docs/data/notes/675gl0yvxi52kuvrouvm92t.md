### Threshold
determines the dB level at which the gate will close and open

### Pre-open
allows the plugin to look ahead and anticipate dB changes that will cause the audio signal volume to surpass the threshold.

### Attack
determines how quickly the gate opens when the signal volume rises above the threshold

### Release
determines how quickly the gate closes when the signal volume again falls below the threshold

### Hold
determines how long to wait after the signal volume falls below the threshold before it begins to close the gate.
