<p>When is it actually beneficial to read complaints online? If you feel negatively toward something (say an airline for its poor service), it can be an isolating feeling to feel you are the only one that feels that way. But looking online at other people's negative experiences with said airline can bring you relief, and confirms that you aren't crazy.</p>
