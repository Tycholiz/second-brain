<p>Diminished chords are commonly used as "migration chords", whereby they will take us from one chord to another</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<ul>
<li>Bennie and the Jets at "...that's been known to change the weather"</li>
<li>All Star - Smash Mouth at "...get your game on, go play"</li>
</ul>

<p>They are also used as line cliches, where we start with a more or less "normal" note, and move through a progression by dropping the base tone.</p>
<ul>
<li>to the ear, it seems all we are doing is just walking down the bass, but in reality we are creating a chord progression.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples</p>
<ul>
<li>Life on Mars - David Bowie at the intro, the progression goes <code>F - Am/E - A°/E♭</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Although diminished chords appear at the 7th scale degree in the major scale, they are not often used like this.</p>
<ul>
<li>the reason is because it's considered to be an incomplete version of the dominant chord.
<ul>
<li>ex. in the key of C major, the 7th scale is a <code>B°</code>, and the dominant is a <code>G⁷</code>, which contains all the notes of the <code>B°</code>.</li>
</ul>
