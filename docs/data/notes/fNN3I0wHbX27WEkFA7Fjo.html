<p>When you get a mortgage on a house, you are essentially shorting the currency that you bought that house in.</p>
<p>The only thing of real value involved in a mortgage in the asset posed as collateral.</p>
<p>A mortgage agreement has monetary value, backed by both the trust of the mortgaged individual and the asset that the mortgage is on.</p>
<p>A mortgage is an I.O.U, and in a sense equivalent to money, since it is portable, exchangeable and saleable.</p>
<p>A mortgage is distinct from a typical borrowing scenario, such as borrowing a hammer from a neighbor. In the financial world, the bank lets us pay with money which it doesn't have.</p>
<p>If the bank didn't have the mortgage in their possession, there would be no money to lend.</p>
