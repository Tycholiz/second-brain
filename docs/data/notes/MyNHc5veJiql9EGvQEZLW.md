# Linear Regression
- When considering stocks, the two variables we are: time (IV) and price (DV) 
- Using linear regression, a trader can identify key price pointsâ€” entry price, stop-loss price, and exit prices.

# Terms
### Price action
- def - the actual historical price of the stock that you see when you look at a chart. This is to be contrasted with non-actual prices, such as moving averages

# Resistance & Support
## Resistance
- When a stock is on the uptrend, a portion of the stock's owners will have sell limit orders where they want to take their profit. This causes the stock to hit a seemingly arbitrary line, called the `resistance`
- all stocks seem to experience resistance at a price ending in ".00m" and also at ".50," although not as strongly. It's as if traders are reluctant to take it to the next dollar level.

## Support
- When a stock is on the downtrend, there are more and more buyers who want to buy in at the better and better discounts. This puts upward pressure on the stock
