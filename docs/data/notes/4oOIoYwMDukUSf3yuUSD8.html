<p>When you want someone to perform a task that is rather difficult, overstate the importance/difficulty of the project.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. Don't say "You have to do this by Friday at two P.M.", but say "I need the impossible done by Friday at two P.M. Can you do it?"</li>
<li>This causes the person to feel that they have a responsibility to work hard for themselves. they are not doing it because they were told, but because they decided to undertake the challenge on their own.</li>
</ul>
<p>if people arenâ€™t aware of their genius, they are not in a position to deliberately utilize it. By telling people what you see, you can raise their awareness and confidence, allowing them to provide their capability more fully.</p>
<p>make it clear to each person why she has been selected for that role. Don't only notice their talent; label it for them.</p>
<p>begin with small, early wins and use those to generate belief toward the greater stretch challenges.</p>
<p>your greatest contribution might depend on your ability to ask the right question, not have the right answer. You will see that all great thinking starts with a provocative question and a rich debate</p>
<p>In terms of inspiring people, your energy is more essential than your message.</p>
