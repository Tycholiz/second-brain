<p>Protons and neutrons are found in the nucleus and are roughly the same size as each other</p>
<p>The number of protons for any given element and is equal to the number of electrons. This is called the atomic number. </p>
<ul>
<li>the atomic number is uniquely characteristic of any given element, and there are no gaps in the list of atomic numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Neutrons carry no charge and play no role in chemical reactions</p>
<p>The protons, neutrons and electrons in any given element are identical to those in every other element. </p>
<ul>
<li>that is, a gold proton is the same as an iron proton. The only thing that makes a gold atom gold and an iron atom iron is the number of protons and electrons it has</li>
</ul>
<p>In chemical reactions, only electrons are detached or exchanged</p>
<ul>
<li>that’s the difference between chemical reactions and nuclear reactions. Nuclear reactions involve breaking the forces of attraction within a nucleus</li>
</ul>
<p>Electrons have a negligible mass, so the total mass of an atom (its mass number) is equal to the combined number of protons and neutrons</p>
<ul>
<li>the atomic mass is usually more than double the atomic number, since usually an element has more neutrons than protons in a nucleus.
<ul>
<li>ex. The atomic number of fluorine is 9 and it’s mass number is 19, allowing us to deduce that it has 9 protons and 10 neutrons</li>
</ul>
