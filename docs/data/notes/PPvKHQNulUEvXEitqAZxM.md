People confuse courtesy with respect.  Everyone deserves courtesy, respect is earned.

think of respect as a currency with a value. When you give everyone respect, you are inflating that currency and making that respect less valuable
- ex. think of how few times John Lennon publicly recognized Paul's work. This makes it so when Paul writes a hit song and John praises it, that praise is elevated in value
