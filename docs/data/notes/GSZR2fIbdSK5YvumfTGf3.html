<p>The idea is that if you take some set of number data and chop off all numbers after the first one, you will have a predictable distribution of numbers</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. take a large list of airline prices over the course of a year.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2021-04-11-20-47-22.png"></p>
<p>What this curve shows is that ~30% of the numbers will start with a <code>1</code>, ~17% with a <code>2</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>In an analysis of Enron, it was found that the numbers they reported did not follow the expected curve.</p>

<p>If you analyze friend count among users, you will see a distribution that follows Benford's Law</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. I have 233 friends (2), you have 125 (1), and so on... the observations will follow Benford's Law distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>This fact has been used to uncover bots who do not have natural friend counts.</p>
<h4 id="elections">Elections<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#elections"></a></h4>
<p>Interestingly, an election where people vote their conscience results in a curve that follows the distribution pattern. However, elections add a degree of complexity, in that humans will vote for someone who is not their first choice if they think that candidate will lose. This disturbs the resulting curve, and as a result will be a curve that is a skewed version of a expected curve.</p>
