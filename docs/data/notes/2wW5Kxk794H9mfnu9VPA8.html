<p>People who are powerful but uncharismatic will tend to be disliked. </p>
<ul>
<li>Their power makes them a target for criticism that they don't have the charisma to disarm</li>
</ul>
<p>Having conviction in your ideas and beliefs is the heart of charisma.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is the belief that things will work out.  That somehow, someway your goals will be achieved.  That no matter what, it will all be okay. </li>
</ul>
<p>Be more concerned with your character than your reputation, because your character is what you really are, while your reputation is merely what others think you are.</p>
<p>Ask yourself these two questions when you get feedback that says you need to change:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have I gotten this feedback consistently? </li>
<li>Are people getting an impression of me that does not align with my values?</li>
</ul>
<p>If two yes's, change. If not, stick to your guns</p>
<p>Someone with real charisma: </p>
<ul>
<li>respects that other people have different opinions </li>
<li>Does not seek other’s approval to make a decision or hold an opinion</li>
<li>Is confident that they will meet other people who will agree with them</li>
</ul>
<p>Charismatic people reveal their flaws</p>
<p>Charismatic people let you know when they’re nervous, pissed, or hurt</p>
<p>Charismatic people don’t worry about fitting in.  They just express themselves honestly, flaws and all</p>
<p>Keep your messages uplifting and positive and people will be drawn to you</p>
<p>Make the subtext of your jokes point to positive traits (“Does it hurt having a brain so big?” is nicer than “God you’re a moron.”)  Whether the tone is serious or goofy, always frame others in the best light possible.</p>
<p>If you want to instantly enthrall people, give a damn about something. Show that passion.</p>
<p>People who have had to struggle for what they’ve got are more likeable</p>
