<p>Fractals are defined as "a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole."</p>
<p>Fractals are phenomenal, because what produces such a complex pattern arises from such a simple mathematical function</p>
<ul>
<li>"think not of what you see, but what it took to produce what you see"</li>
</ul>
<p>Roughness is a key factor of fractals. Consider that if we had a perfectly straight coastline, there would be no apparent fractal.</p>
<p>Prices of a commodity (like cotton) takes a fractal pattern; the graph of one day prices looks like a graph of one year, which looks like a graph of 10 years</p>
<p>In nature, a fractal can be thought of an a solution that natural selection has come up with over and over again.</p>
<p>Other examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trees - You will find fractals at every level of the forest ecosystem from seeds and pinecones, to branches and leaves</li>
<li>River Deltas</li>
<li>Clouds</li>
<li>Mountains</li>
<li>Flowers</li>
<li>Coastal areas</li>
<li>Spider web</li>
</ul>
<p>You can create a fractal by taking a smooth-looking shape and breaking it into pieces over and over again.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. To make a mountain range, all you'd do is start with a few very broad triangles. Within each triangle, break it apart into smaller triangles, and continue doing this again and again until the shape starts to formulate.
