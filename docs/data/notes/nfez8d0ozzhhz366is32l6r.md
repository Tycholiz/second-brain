cones are assumed to be *right circular*, meaning that the base is circular and that the axis passes through the centre of the base at right angles to its plane

A cone (such as a heaped pile of sand) has exactly one third of the volume of a surrounding cylinder:

A cone has about one quarter of the volume (actually 26.18%) of a surrounding box with a square base:
