<p>the left side of the brain is involved in pattern recognition. this means it is a fallacy to think "the left side controls language". in fact, it only controls language insofar as there is a pattern recognition aspect to language</p>
<ul>
<li>another consequence of this pattern recognition nature is that the left side is what causes us to retroactively create narratives to explain events
the right side of the brain is involved in novelty. it tends to see series of facts (the particular, the trees)
aa dopamine rises, pattern recognition also rises. this results in us being vulnerable to pattern recognition and being less skeptical</li>
