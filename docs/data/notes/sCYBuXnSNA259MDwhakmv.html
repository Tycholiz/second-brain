<p>Identity is not about what you believe, it’s about what you value</p>
<ul>
<li>This leaves you open to changing your views. If you value things like: truth, honesty, integrity etc, then that value system will inform your beliefs. If we start at beliefs, then we are essentially outsourcing what we find valuable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your identity creates a kind of "pride" that encourages you to deny your weak spots and prevents you from truly growing.</p>
<p>The more sacred an idea is to us - that is, the more deeply it is tied to our identity - the more strongly we will defend it against criticism.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. The veteran who is committed to doing things “his way.”</li>
<li>ex. The band who produces a mind-blowing first album and then gets stuck in a rut.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid making any single aspect of your identity an overwhelming portion of who you are.</li>
<li>Keep your identity small.</li>
</ul>
