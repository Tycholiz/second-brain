<ul>
<li>The idea of looking for solutions to a problem by looking at the inverse of the obvious path (ie. subtractive instead of additive)
<ul>
<li>ex. we want to improve innovation in the organization. The obvious is to think of ways to increase innovation. Looking at this problem with a lens of inversion would encourage you to think of ways to discourage innovation. Then, you determine that "these are the things we need to avoid".</li>
<li>ex. rather than think about "what makes a good life?", think about "what makes a miserable life?"</li>
<li>The idea is that avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance.</li>
<li>Often people have the best intentions, but end up causing more harm than good.</li>
</ul>
