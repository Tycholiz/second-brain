### Two types of metrics to measure success in achieveing goals:
- Lag measure - a measure of the thing you are ultimately trying to improve. This is the metric that tells you if you've actually achieved the goal. Called *lag* because by the time you see them, the action taken to achieve those goals has already passed. You see it *after* the fact
    - Difficult to use for growth, since the data comes when it's too late.
    - Cannot be directly influenced, since it has already happened.
    - Can be tempting to focus on, since they are easier to measure, and they represent the result we ultimately want.
    - ***ex.*** - weight loss, revenue growth
- Lead measure - Tells you if you are likely to achieve the goal. These are the metrics that serve as predictors of success
    - ***ex.*** - eating healthy and exercising *predict* a healthy body and mind, while tracking weight is too detached from the actions that lead to being healthy.
- ***analogy*** lead/lag indicators in economics
