*Noise* is junk data that must be accounted for in any type of statistical analysis. Signals are the good part of the data spectrum that are contrasted with noise. 

Noise increases with the frequency of data

If we get a condensed version of the news just once per year, the signal to noise ratio might be 1:1. If on the other hand we watch it every day, it might be more like 50:1.
