# $\cap$
The intersection of two sets is the set consisting of *only* the elements that appear in both sets.
- $A \cap B$ denotes the intersection of sets $A$ and $B$.
  - ex. $G \cap D = \{Alice\}$ means that "Alice is a part of both set $A$ and set $B$".

Two sets whose intersection is the empty set (in other words, have no element in common) are called *disjoint*.

### Example: Yelp
- $A =$ The set of Yelp users who like Biz1
- $B =$ The set of Yelp users who like Biz2

The set $A \cap B$ is the set of users that liked both Biz1 and Biz2
