### Phrases
Phrases are small parts, consisting of anywhere from one to several notes.

Phrases can be categoried as one of 3 types:
- A - the first phrase played. Sets the stage
- B - mimics the A phrase in some way, but is distinct.
  - can derive a B phrase from an A phrase by changing, adding, subtracing, mirroring (ie. doing the same note pattern but in reverse) or relocating (shifting hand position up/down string-wise (ie. not fret-wise))
- C - something different
