<h2 id="mono">Mono<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#mono"></a></h2>
<p>Mono (short for monophonic) means one channel of audio. </p>
<ul>
<li>when recording a microphone into an audio interface using one microphone and one channel, that is the definition of mono</li>
</ul>
<p>When we have a mono signal in our DAW, eventually it gets sent to a stereo bus. Itâ€™s technically still mono information, but that same mono signal is now sent both to L and R. This is what creates a centre image.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mono information in a stereo environment equals <em>centre information</em>. As our ears hear the same thing from either side at the same volume and at the same time, our brains localise that as centre</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stereo">Stereo<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#stereo"></a></h2>
<p>Stereo (short for stereophonic) means more than one channel of audio. </p>
<ul>
<li>precisely, it is the reproduction of sound using 2+ independent audio channels</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="stereo-image">Stereo Image<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#stereo-image"></a></h3>
<p>Stereo width is achieved when what comes out of the left is different to that of the right.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. when tracking guitars, record the same part twice and pan them left and right respectively. This works because they are two different pieces of audio, giving off a sensation of width.</li>
</ul>
<p>A wide stereo image is when a sound seems to be coming from multiple angles (like a wall of sound)</p>
<ul>
<li>the more different the sound out of L is from R, the wider the stereo image. The more similar L is to R, the narrower the image.</li>
</ul>
