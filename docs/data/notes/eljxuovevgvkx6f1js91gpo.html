<p>Distorted electric guitar is not normally compressed, since they are basically already compressed</p>
<ul>
<li>same with square-waved synths</li>
<li>note, this does not apply to using a multi-band compressor in order to tone shape, as this solved a different issue altogether</li>

<h3 id="eq">EQ<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#eq"></a></h3>
<p>Most of the problem frequencies in acoustic guitar are in mid-range (somewhere around 900-1000 hZ)</p>
<p>High frequencies (~8k-10k hZ) are typically undesirable, so it's a good idea to use a high cut filter.</p>
<p>Overdriven guitars benefit from slight boosts (~5-10dB) in the midrange (~1k hZ)</p>
<p>Try cutting the <em>oomph</em> sound made by the pick hitting the strings on the downstroke, which typically occurs somewhere between 150-200hZ</p>
<ul>
<li>this sound can be seen in the soundwave as the loudest point in the wave, occuring right at the start of the sound.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's nothing really of value at around 50hZ and below, so cut it all out with a high-pass filter</p>
<ul>
<li>you probably won't hear a difference, but this sound may manifest on woofers of different speaker systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>If guitar sounds a little dull, experiment with:</p>

<p>Acoustic guitar can sometimes do without compression. Only use it as a remedy to some issue.</p>
<p>Use fast attack time if the guitarist is inconsistent with dynamic range (ie. playing loud in some parts and quiet in others)</p>
