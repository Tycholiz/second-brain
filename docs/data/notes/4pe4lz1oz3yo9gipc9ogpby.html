<p>Doubling is extremely effective in creating depth and space</p>
<ul>
<li>Doubles can be panned together adding depth and unique character, or they can be panned apart to add width.</li>
<li>ex. try panning them wide during verses, and centre during chorus</li>
<li>ex. try panning early verses/choruses wide, but pan centre during later ones for added intensity.</li>
</ul>
<p>note: breaths and sibilance (s’s and t’s) can be extremely distracting when out of time. As such, they can simply be removed completely from Vocal2.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, consider reducing the s’s and t’s in the doubles with de-essing so as not to clash with the main vocal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider not always using double tracking on every word. Save double tracking for emphasis on select lines to emphasize a lyric.</p>
<p>Consider using a different microphone for Vocal2, which will create some separation, texture and depth in the vocal mix.</p>
<p>To create a lot of vocal power, consider having two separate vocal doubles. Pan the main vocal centre, and pan each double track hard left and right respectively.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-double">Types of Double<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#types-of-double"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Unison (ie. Double)</li>
<li>Octave - singing an octave higher/lower than main vocal line. Tuck it a little lower in the mix than the lead vocal
<ul>
<li>ex. <a href="https://youtu.be/bhh6alcX7Yo?t=419">falsetto double</a></li>
<li>ex. <a href="https://youtu.be/bhh6alcX7Yo?t=444">lower octave double</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Melodic interval
<ul>

<h3 id="try">Try<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#try"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>vocal1 panned centre, and vocal2 panned hard left, with slight delay panned hard right</li>
<li>lead vocal panned centre, with 2 unison double tracks panned hard left and right to result in a thick vocal</li>
<li>lead vocal panned centre, with 2 lower octave double tracks panned ~50% left and right, so as to support (and not distract from) the lead vocal</li>
</ul>
