<ul>
<li>what do meetings look like?</li>
<li>how is mentorship viewed?</li>
<li>what ratio of work is ticket-related? Is there an allowance of time to just learn new (somewhat relevant) things? how about time to do off-the-desk work, like writing documentation, or writing RFCs?</li>
<li>Pagerduty?</li>
<li>Timetracking?</li>
<li>work/life balance?</li>
<li>can you tell me a little about the financial state of the company?</li>
<li>what is your and the team's philosophy on code reviews?</li>
<li>workflow of tickets: 
<ul>
<li>who makes tickets? </li>
<li>how are tickets assigned?</li>
<li>how does code review work?</li>
<li>how does code get merged?</li>
<li>how does deployment work?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How do you envision the structure of your ideal team?
<ul>
<li>ex. everyone full-stack vs split of backend+frontend+infra</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>how do you think about getting to that ideal level of collaboration amongst people on your team? How do you encourage collaboration, and how do you encourage cross-pollination of ideas so that the sum of parts is more than each individual?</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="structured-for-email">Structured for email<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#structured-for-email"></a></h5>
<ol>
<li>How is development work structured at the company? Does the team follow some incarnation of scrum? What kind of rituals would we expect to have (daily stand-ups, sprints, retro etc.)</li>
<li>Somewhat of a follow-up to the previous question, what is the meeting culture like at the company? How is sync up made with teammates?</li>
<li>How fragmented is team knowledge? On a scale of "each member is expected to be a specialist in their area" to "each member is expected to be a generalist for more or less the whole system", where would you place the expectation?</li>
<li>Is there an on-call component, such as PagerDuty or something similar? If so, with what frequency does duty occur and for how long?</li>
<li>How is work-to-be-done derived? Do we have product managers and designers who create goals? Do they work closely with developers? </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="30-second-pitch-written">30 second pitch (written)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#30-second-pitch-written"></a></h3>
<p>As a mid-level software engineer, I bring a unique perspective to software development. I started my career as a UI/UX designer, but quickly realized the limitations of not knowing how to code. I taught myself front-end development and became the sole developer in a small local start-up. I then expanded my skills to become a full-stack developer, playing key roles as a system architect and database administrator. With a proven track record of being able to learn quickly and continuously improving my skills, I am able to quickly adapt to new technologies and understand how they fit into the bigger picture of the architecture. I like to see myself as the tide that rises all boats; A versatile and adaptable support team member who is able to jump in and perform a multitude of varied tasks as they present themselves.</p>

<p>Ok, so my unique value perspective that I bring. I started out my career by doing UI/UX design. It didn't take long before I realized the limitations of not knowing how to code, so I taught myself front-end development. I took my first professional position as the sole developer in a small local start-up. From there, my curiosity got the better of me, and I expanded my skills to move more into the backend, becoming a full-stack developer. I joined another startup, and since no one else volunteered for the job, I played the role of database administrator and served as one of the principal system architects administrator.</p>
