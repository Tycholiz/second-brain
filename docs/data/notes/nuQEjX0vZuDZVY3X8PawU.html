<h1 id="anchoring">Anchoring<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#anchoring"></a></h1>
<p>When anchoring, people will start at the anchored amount, then continuously adjust up/down until they are no longer certain if they should still be adjusting or not (region of uncertainty). </p>
<ul>
<li>In other words, as soon as you start entering the region of uncertainty, you stop.</li>
</ul>
<p>When presented with an anchoring situation, we know 2 things off the bat: that the anchor is wrong, and which direction to move in. The method that we "move" is by making arguments</p>
<p>People adjust less (ie. Stay closer to the anchor) when mentally depleted</p>
<p>The anchor does not have to be related to what is being estimated. Anchors do not have their effects because people believe they're informative</p>
<p>Anchoring examples: coming off highway at 120km and entering city where limit is 60km feels awkward.</p>
<p>price tags by themselves are not necessarily anchors. They become anchors when we contemplate buying a product or service at that particular price.</p>

<p>saying 30 degrees celsius evokes thoughts of sun and the beach, while 0 degrees evokes thoughts of snow and ice</p>
<p>The selective activation of compatible memories explains anchoring: the high and the low numbers activate different sets of ideas in memory.</p>
<h2 id="resisting-anchoring">Resisting anchoring<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#resisting-anchoring"></a></h2>
<p>focus attention on arguments of why the anchor is wrong. Focus attention on the minimal offer that the person would reasonably accept, and cement that as your anchor</p>
