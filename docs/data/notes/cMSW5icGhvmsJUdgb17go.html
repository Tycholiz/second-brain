<li>Light in an optical cable will travel at a speed of ~200,000km/s (66% speed of light in a vacuum)
<ul>
<li>Put another way, it takes 5ms to travel 1,000km</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Light travels in every direction from its source in what is known as a <em>light cone</em> </p>
<ul>
<li>a light cone exists in a single moment in space and time</li>
</ul>
<p>The Discovery space shuttle is capable of travelling at speeds of 5 miles per second. Even at this speed it would still take 37,200 years to travel 1 light year.</p>
<p>1 light year is ~9.46 trillion kilometers</p>
