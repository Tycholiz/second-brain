Whereas Differential Calculus cuts something into small pieces to find how it changes, Integral Calculus joins (integrates) the small pieces together to find how much there is.

Integration is the study of the area beneath a curve. 

[[differentiation|math.calculus.differentiation]] is the reverse process to integration.

Integration serves as a tool to solve problems in mathematics and physics involving the area of an arbitrary shape, the length of a curve, and the volume of a solid, among others.
