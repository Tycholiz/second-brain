"Shame is the fear of not being worthy of connection"
- Brene Brown

If you do something you regret or are shameful about, own the story. If you bury it and let it fester, then it defines you. It is history. However, if you own it, you get to write the ending. The story hasn't finished yet, and you get to make it right. When we bury the story, we forever stay the subject  if we own it, we get to narrate the ending.

Sometimes, narcissism is a shame-based fear of being ordinary
- sometimes humanizing problems like this sheds an important light on them, which often goes out as soon as a label is applied (see next point)
- for this reason, it is not logical to place the blame on others for being the way they are. It is notdifficult to sympathize with people who are narcissistic, because they're simply a product of the times we're living in. In an age of social media addiction, phone addiction, reality TV shows... It is understandable that people might try and hold themselves to a standard that is simply unrealistic. If narcissism arises as a result of this reality, then it is hard to place the blame at the feet of the people.

# Causes of disengagement
- protection against vulnerability, shame, and feeling lost without purpose
- feeling like the people who are leading is are not fulfilling their end of the social contract
  - boss, teacher, parents, politicians etc.
