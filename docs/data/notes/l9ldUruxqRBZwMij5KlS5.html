<p>"Addiction is giving up everything for one thing. Sobriety is giving up one thing for everything"</p>
<p>ask yourself "is the behaviour I'm exhibiting right now the same behaviour I'd exhibit if I were in fact dangerously addicted to this thing?"</p>
<ul>
<li>In other words, imagine a scenario where things ended up bad for you. Are you current patterns reflecting the same pattern that this hypothetical would probably would have shown? </li>
<li>ex. Think WoW. When I started playing Classic WoW, I played a lot (9 hours in one day). I should have imagined the hypothetical scenario where I get dangerously addicted to WoW and stop working on my projects. would the pattern that caused the hypothetical still be there in my actual life? </li>
</ul>
<p>When can natural reinforcers become addictive?</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>when something is available in limitless supply
