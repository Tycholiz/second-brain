<p>Whereas Differential Calculus cuts something into small pieces to find how it changes, Integral Calculus joins (integrates) the small pieces together to find how much there is.</p>
<p>Integration is the study of the area beneath a curve. </p>
<p><a href="/notes/yqXKkFQR8gRzNTbsh0wno">differentiation</a> is the reverse process to integration.</p>
<p>Integration serves as a tool to solve problems in mathematics and physics involving the area of an arbitrary shape, the length of a curve, and the volume of a solid, among others.</p>
