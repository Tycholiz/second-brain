<p>A chord (in a <em>tertian harmonic</em> sense; ie. harmony built on thirds) must have all of its notes a third apart (either minor or major)</p>
<ul>
<li>this rule holds true for extended chords (e.g. <code>9th</code>, <code>11th</code> chords), since the 9th is a minor third above the 7th, </li>
</ul>
<p>chords are often augmented with "tensions". A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively dissonant interval in relation to the bass.</p>
<ul>
<li>Harmonization usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between consonance and dissonance. Simply put, this occurs when there is a balance between "tense" and "relaxed" moments. </li>
<li>A misplayed note or any sound that is judged to detract from the whole composition can be described as disharmonious rather than dissonant. </li>
</ul>
<p>Think of a chord as a harmonic structure that supports melody</p>
<h3 id="augmented">Augmented<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#augmented"></a></h3>
<p>Augmented chords can be used as a substitute for a dominant chord.</p>
<p>Augmented can be used to increase the tension of the V chord, before bringing it back to the tonic, creating an even bigger resolution.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh! Darling - Beatles (opening chord)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you take a minor triad and augment the 5th you wind up with a major triad of the augmented note</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. Gm with an augmented 5th yields an E♭ major chord.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="add-chords">Add chords<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#add-chords"></a></h3>
<p>An add chord simply adds the scale degree to the chord</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. a C6 chord is a Cmajor with the 6th</li>
</ul>
<p><code>add</code> chords notably don't remove the 3rd, making <code>add2</code> and <code>add4</code> chords distinct from <code>sus2</code> / <code>sus4</code></p>
<p>Try arpeggiated <code>add♯4</code> and let the bass drive the progression.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lydian</li>
</ul>
<p>Try arpeggiated <code>addb2</code> and let the bass drive the progression.</p>
<ul>
<li>Phrygian</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="extension-chords-compound-intervals">Extension chords (compound intervals)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#extension-chords-compound-intervals"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>ex. 9th, 11th, 13th
They are called compound because they are greater than one octave</li>
</ul>
<p>Compound chords are normally played with the 7th.</p>
<ul>
<li>this is the principal difference between an <code>add2</code> chord and a <code>9th</code> chord</li>
</ul>

<p>Arpeggiated, provides a mysterious vibe</p>
<h3 id="slash-chords-eg-ce">Slash chords (e.g. <code>C/E</code>)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#slash-chords-eg-ce"></a></h3>
<p>A slash chord denotes which note should be played in the most bass register</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. if we have a <code>C/E</code> chord, we should play a C major chord with notes <code>E</code>/<code>G</code>/<code>C</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the slash chord contains a note not found in the chord (e.g. <code>C/B</code>, since <code>B</code> is not part of C major), then we have to reconstruct the chord. In this case, a <code>C/B</code> chord is a <code>Cmaj7</code> chord with <code>B</code> in the lowest register.</p>

<p>They work well together because they offer a lot of space to work with. They are fairly neutral sounding, and therefore a lot of melodies can work with them.</p>
