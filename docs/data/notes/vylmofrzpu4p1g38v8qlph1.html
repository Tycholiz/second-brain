<h1 id="cadence">Cadence<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#cadence"></a></h1>
<p>A cadence is the end of the phrase that provides some sort of resolution.</p>
<ul>
<li>a cadence is characterized by its degree of <em>strength</em> or <em>weakness</em>, depending on the impression of finality it gives.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cadences are strong indicators of the tonic or central pitch of a passage or piece.</p>
<p>Cadences are usually classified by a specific chord progression, but even if that progression is played, it doesn't necessarily imply a cadence. To be a cadence, it must occur at the end of a phrase and provide some sense of finality.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. an Authentic Cadence is <code>V-I</code>, but that doesn't mean every time those 2 chords are played it is a cadence. </li>
</ul>

<p>A seventh above the root is often added to create <code>V⁷</code></p>
<p>Authentic cadences are generally classified as either perfect or imperfect.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>perfect</em> (PAC) - the chords are in <a href="/notes/835g6b5tm31egcjhjefoe0v#root-position1">root position</a> and the tonic is in the highest voice of the final chord.
<ul>
<li>considered the strongest type of cadence and often found at structurally defining moments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>imperfect</em> (IAC) - of which there are 3 types:
<ul>
<li><em>Root position</em>: Similar to a perfect authentic cadence, but the highest voice is not the tonic.</li>
<li><em>Inverted</em>: Similar to a perfect authentic cadence, but one or both chords are inverted.</li>
<li><em>Leading-tone</em>: The V chord is replaced with the <code>vii°</code> chord (but the cadence still ends on <code>I</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>"This cadence is a microcosm of the tonal system, and is the most direct means of establishing a pitch as tonic. It is virtually obligatory as the final structural cadence of a tonal work."</em></p>
