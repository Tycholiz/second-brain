<p><em>"Whoever controls the silence has the power".</em></p>
<p>Whoever controls the options has the power. Creating choices for yourself gives you power.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. Game of thrones. Tyrion didn't like two options of execution or exile, so created a third option: trial by combat, thus retaining power over the situation</li>
</ul>
