The interior angles of a triangle always add up to 180°

- angles A are the same
- angles B are the same

the area of any polygon can be found by dividing the polygon into triangles.
- [see: Polygon Triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_triangulation)
- For shapes with curved boundary, [[calculus|math.calculus]] is usually required to compute the area.

# Right Triangles
The interesting thing about right triangles is that they are one half of a rectangle.
- therefore, anything that can be figured out with a rectangle can also be figured out with a right triangle
    - ex. area of a rectangle is $H \times W$, area of right triangle is ${H \times W} \over 2$

## Pythagorean theorem
The theory states that the area of the square on the side of the hypotenuse ($c$) is equal to the area of $b + c$

Therefore, with this formula, given the lengths of 2 sides we can find the length of the 3rd.

This formula can also be used to determine if an angle is truly 90°. Simply measure the length of each side and plug it in to the formula to see if both sides equal each other.

## Sine, Cosine, Tangent
purpose: given an angle and length of a side of a right triangle, get the other side

The main functions in trigonometry are Sine, Cosine and Tangent
- each function is simply one side of a right-angled triangle divided by another.
- Their general rule is when we know any 3 of the sides or angles, we can find the other 3 (except for the three angles case)

The triangle can be large or small and the ratio of sides stays the same. Only the angle changes the ratio.

### Sine
Sine is the ratio of $Opposite \over Hypotenuse$

- ex. when doing a Sine calculation, 45° results in 0.7071. This number represents the ratio of the side lengths, which would mean that the Opposite is about 0.7071 times as long as the Hypotenuse.

## Arcsine, Arccosine, Arctangent (inverse trig functions)
purpose: given the lengths of 2 sides of a right triangle, get the angle

While the *sine* function takes an angle and returns the ratio of $opposite / hypotenuse$, *arcsine* (ie. inverse sine) takes a ratio and returns the angle.
- ie.  If the sine of 30° is 0.5, then the arcsine of 0.5 is 30°:

## Cotangent, Secant, Cosecant
Like Sine, Cosine and Tangent, these functions all involve dividing one side by another
- secant is equal to 1 divided by cos
- cosecant is equal to 1 divided by sin
- cotangent is equal to 1 divided by tan
