## Probability of Union sets
The general probability addition rule for the union of two events states that 
- $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) âˆ’ P(A \cap B)$, where $A \cap B$ is the intersection of the two sets.

The addition rule can be shortened if the sets are disjoint (ie. have no members in common): 
- $P(A \cup B) = P (A) + P (B)$

can even be extended to more sets if they are all disjoint: 
- $P( A \cup B \cup C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C)$
