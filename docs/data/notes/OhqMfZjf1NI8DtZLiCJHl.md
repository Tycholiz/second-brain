drink 3 glasses of water before bed if you want to remember dreams because it causes you to wake up

you can influence your dreams by spending a lot of time doing a particular thing
- ex. a group of people were asked to play Tetris all day for a week straight. This resulted in their dreams having more Tetris-like shapes
