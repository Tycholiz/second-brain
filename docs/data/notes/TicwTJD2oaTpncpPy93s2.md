privilege isn't about having an easy life, it's about not having to consider those difficult questions that were posed
- questions like:
    - "will there be an elevator where we are going?"
    - "will people look at me weird when they see me holding hands with another man?"

*“If you want to talk about privilege, I feel class is the big divider, much more than race and gender.”*
