<p>Game Theory is the study of how to play "optimally"</p>
<ul>
<li>You discover your best strategy, the opponent learns and adapts, you adapt as a result of that adaptation, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you playing a co-operative game or a non-cooperative game? This is a question you have to ask when assessing whether or not game-theory apply</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. should I change lanes in slow traffic?</li>
</ul>
