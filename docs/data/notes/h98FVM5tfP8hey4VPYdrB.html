<p>When designing a formula, you want to include as variables, any of your current variable's dependents.  </p>
<ul>
<li>ex. I am making a spreadsheet to calculate RoI by year, and have as a variable <code>biweeklyContribution: Number</code>. This variable naturally depends on the person's salary, so instead of <code>biweeklyContribution</code> being a constant, we should introduce 2 new constants: <code>annualSalary: Number</code> and <code>contributionPercentage: Number</code> and make <code>biweeklyContribution</code> its own formul derived by multiplying the two.</li>
</ul>
