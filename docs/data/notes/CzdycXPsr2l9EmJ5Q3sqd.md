# Joni Tuning Notation
A series of 6 characters, where
- The first is a letter corresponding to the note of the low string
- The rest are numbers corresponding to the fret needed to depress to play the same note on the next string

There are a few clear benefits to knowing tunings this way:
- Easier to change tunings, given the first reference note
- Easy to recognize when something is just a standard tuning dropped half a step (`D#55545`)

## Example
Standard tuning would be `E55545`

Interesting tunings:
