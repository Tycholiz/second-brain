### Sharpe Ratio
- helps to understand a stock's performance in relation to the risk it has had
- Drawbacks are:
	1. uses SD, meaning we are assuming that the returns are normally distributed
		- The stock market is less than a perfect normal distribution, because of a large number of surprising drops and spikes in prices.
- the value tells us how much the excess return it has had, in relation to the volatility it has endured (some might call risk).
	- a higher number tells us that the stock did well, considering how risky it was
	- The volatility considered in terms of âˆ†Standard Deviation of Excess return (ie. "how much more volatile is this stock than the market?")
- Risk premium = how much percentage *over* the market rate the stock is expected to return (ie. `expected return - risk-free rate`)
- spec: seems to be a backward-looking and limited-use formula
