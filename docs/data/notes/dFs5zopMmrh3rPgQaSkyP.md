### Dennett's criticism framework
How to compose a successful critical commentary (Daniel Dennett):
1. You should attempt to re-express your target's position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, "Thanks, I wish Iâ€™d thought of putting it that way."
2. You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).
3. You should mention anything you have learned from your target.
4. Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.

### Three broad types of criticism:
- criticism of practice and application (basically how good of a job they did), 
- criticism of taste, 
- criticism of the person themselves, whether it was a personal attack or attack of the person's work.
