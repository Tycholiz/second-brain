<h1 id="cpi">CPI<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#cpi"></a></h1>
<p>The CPI either understates or overstates cost-of-living increases.</p>
<ul>
<li>known as the index number problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>The CPI is supposed to represent the average Canadian household's spending habits. For this reason, a weighted average is used.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. Canadians spend approximately 16% of their household budget on Food, (which further breaks down in other categories), 27% on Shelter, and 19% on Transportation, etc. This overall level of our spending is factored into the calculation of the CPI.
<ul>
<li>This shows how it is inherent in the model of the CPI that we are talking about averages here. There is no single individual that exists that will pay <em>exactly</em> 5% more from last year if CPI is 5%. What results is a bell curve, and each individual may reside on either side of that average.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The CPI also breaks down how much weight each province is given in the calculation.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. Ontario carries an expenditure share of 39.83%, which means that consumption in Ontario represents 39.83% of all household consumer spending in Canada</li>
<li>ex. British Columbians contribute more to overall consumer spending than Yukoners, so the changing prices in B.C. will be given more consideration.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the province's consumer expenditure on a particular commodity is negligible, then it may be withheld from the calculation</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. The average Albertan's yearly expenditure on fuel is so low that it isn't even included in their CPI calculation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="base-period">Base period<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#base-period"></a></h3>
<p>The CPI is arbitrarily set to equal 100 in the index base period.</p>
<ul>
<li>meaning all index values express price change in percentage terms in comparison to the index base period</li>
<li>ex. if the index is 123.4, that means prices have increased 23.4% since the base period. As of 2021, the index base period of the CPI is 2002.</li>
