A vector is a line that has both magnitude and direction
- therefore it can represent:
    - the force of gravity on an object
    - the strength and direction of the Earth's magnetic field
    - velocity of a particle in a flowing fluid
    - an area (here, all we have to do is make the vector the same length as the 2D surface, and make its direction perpendicular to that surface)

### Basis Vectors
Basis vectors have a length of 1 unit, and have a direction that is equal to one of the coordinate axes.
- in a 3D cartesian coordinate system, we have 3 coordinate axes ($x$, $y$, $z$). The basis vectors must be alone one of these lines.

- $\hat{x}$ (sometimes $\hat{i}$) - represents a basis vector along the $x$ axis
- $\hat{y}$ (sometimes $\hat{j}$) - represents a basis vector along the $x$ axis
- $\hat{z}$ (sometimes $\hat{k}$) - represents a basis vector along the $x$ axis

### Vector Components
The components of a vector tell us how much of each coordinate (e.g $x$, $y$, $z$) we need to get to the tip of our line (remember, the vector starts at $0, 0$, so by getting the coordinate we also know exactly how long the line is)
- ex. with coordinates $3, 5$, the $x$ component of our line is $3$, and the $y$ components is $5$

- $A_{x}$ - represents the $x$ vector component of Vector $A$

In order to find the components of the vector, we must first have in place the coordinate system and the basis vectors
