<p>It's not that there are 3 different minor scales; it's that there are 3 variations of the same scale.</p>
<ul>
<li>that is, some notes of the minor scale may be changed around to achieve some kind of melodic harmony.</li>
<li>note: that there are other forms of minor scales too. There's the pentatonic minor, Hungarian minor, Jazz minor, Neapolitan and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chords that sound nice with the scale:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>min7</code> (minor 3rd, minor 7th)
<ul>
<li>ex. C-E♭-G-B♭</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The major scale features a half-step between the 7th and 8th notes of the scale. This interval has a sort of tension-resolution effect. On the other hand, the natural minor scale doesn't have this same feature, since there is a whole step between the 7th and 8th scale degrees. </p>
<p>This is why the harmonic minor scale exists: it allows us to add that tension-resolution interval to the minor scale. The only difference between it and the natural minor is the raised 7th.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a result, when playing in a minor scale, the 7th is only really sharpened when we are going for that tension-resolution effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only difference from the natural minor is that the 7th is sharpened, giving us a leading tone, making it want to point back to the tonic</p>
<p>Chords that sound nice with the scale:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>minMaj7</code> (minor 3rd, major 7th)
<ul>
<li>ex. C Eb G B</li>
<li>this can be used as the <code>i</code></li>
<li>this works because the chord is formed by the <code>i</code>, <code>iii</code>, <code>v</code> and <code>vii</code> degrees of the harmonic minor scale.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>dim</code>
<ul>
<li>can be extended by adding a minor 7th (<code>D°⁷</code>/<code>Dmin7♭5</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="melodic-minor">Melodic minor<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#melodic-minor"></a></h2>
<p>A problem arises with the harmonic minor: the interval between the 6th and 7th scale degrees is 3 semitones, which is rather large.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. in A harmonic minor, this interval is <code>F</code>-<code>G♯</code></li>
<li>To compensate, we can simply raise the 6th so that the interval is only a major 2nd
<ul>
<li>doing this creates a smoother melody when we are leading towards a tonic. However, when we are moving away from a tonic, the natural minor is typically used.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Characterized by the flat 3rd, sharp 6th and sharp 7th</p>
<p>ques: what's the association between natural minor and Dorian?</p>
