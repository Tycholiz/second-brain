A chord (in a *tertian harmonic* sense; ie. harmony built on thirds) must have all of its notes a third apart (either minor or major)
- this rule holds true for extended chords (e.g. `9th`, `11th` chords), since the 9th is a minor third above the 7th, 

chords are often augmented with "tensions". A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively dissonant interval in relation to the bass.
- Harmonization usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between consonance and dissonance. Simply put, this occurs when there is a balance between "tense" and "relaxed" moments. 
- A misplayed note or any sound that is judged to detract from the whole composition can be described as disharmonious rather than dissonant. 

Think of a chord as a harmonic structure that supports melody

### Augmented
Augmented chords can be used as a substitute for a dominant chord.

Augmented can be used to increase the tension of the V chord, before bringing it back to the tonic, creating an even bigger resolution.

Examples:
- Oh! Darling - Beatles (opening chord)

If you take a minor triad and augment the 5th you wind up with a major triad of the augmented note
- ex. Gm with an augmented 5th yields an E♭ major chord.

### Add chords
An add chord simply adds the scale degree to the chord
- ex. a C6 chord is a Cmajor with the 6th

`add` chords notably don't remove the 3rd, making `add2` and `add4` chords distinct from `sus2` / `sus4`

Try arpeggiated `add♯4` and let the bass drive the progression.
- Lydian

Try arpeggiated `addb2` and let the bass drive the progression.
- Phrygian

### Extension chords (compound intervals)
- ex. 9th, 11th, 13th
They are called compound because they are greater than one octave

Compound chords are normally played with the 7th.
- this is the principal difference between an `add2` chord and a `9th` chord

### Augmented 5th (aka minor 6th)
Arpeggiated, provides a mysterious vibe

### Slash chords (e.g. `C/E`)
A slash chord denotes which note should be played in the most bass register
- ex. if we have a `C/E` chord, we should play a C major chord with notes `E`/`G`/`C`.

If the slash chord contains a note not found in the chord (e.g. `C/B`, since `B` is not part of C major), then we have to reconstruct the chord. In this case, a `C/B` chord is a `Cmaj7` chord with `B` in the lowest register.

### The Four Chords (I-V-vi-IV)
They work well together because they offer a lot of space to work with. They are fairly neutral sounding, and therefore a lot of melodies can work with them.
