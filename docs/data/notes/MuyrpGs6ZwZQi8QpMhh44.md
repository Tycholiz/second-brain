A tool that allows us to cut and reprogram our DNA
- ex. if there is a sequence in our DNA that causes sickle cell in our blood, we can use CRISPR to edit that sequence out.

CRISPR simply does what bacteria has been doing for a billion years.
- bacteria have these clustered, repeated and interspersed sequences known as CRISPRs in their own genetic makeup.
	- The bacteria takes a mugshot of the virus that attacks. Then when the virus attacks again, the bacteria uses the scissors (known as an enzyme) to cut it out.
