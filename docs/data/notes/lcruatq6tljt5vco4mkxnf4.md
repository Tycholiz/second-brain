A major 6th chord is identical to the minor 7th of the relative key (albeit in a different inversion)
- ex. C6 is the same as Am7
- writing a chord as 6th instead of the equivalent 7th is obscuring the harmonic quality of the chord, making it more difficult to know which notes belong.
  - there is one exception to this, which is dependent on the context. Imagine we play a `Cmaj7` chord, then drop the 7th to a 6 to play a `Cmaj6` chord. In this context, the `C` still feels like the tonal centre (as it did with the `Cmaj7` chord). In this case, it's more appropriate to think of that 6th chord as a 6th chord and not a 7th of the relative key.

When specifying a minor/major 6th chord, the minor/major refers to the third (meaning the 6th note is the same in both)


### 6/9 (aka 6add9)
#### Major
Cmaj6/9: 32223x

It is not a tense chord, and therefore doesn't require resolution.

Considered a substitute for the tonic in Jazz

#### Minor
Cmin6/9: 32233x

Evokes the dorian mode

Also considered a substitute for the minor tonic in Jazz.
