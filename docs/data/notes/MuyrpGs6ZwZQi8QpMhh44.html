<h1 id="crispr">CRISPR<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#crispr"></a></h1>
<p>A tool that allows us to cut and reprogram our DNA</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. if there is a sequence in our DNA that causes sickle cell in our blood, we can use CRISPR to edit that sequence out.</li>
</ul>
<p>CRISPR simply does what bacteria has been doing for a billion years.</p>
<ul>
<li>bacteria have these clustered, repeated and interspersed sequences known as CRISPRs in their own genetic makeup.
<ul>
<li>The bacteria takes a mugshot of the virus that attacks. Then when the virus attacks again, the bacteria uses the scissors (known as an enzyme) to cut it out.</li>
