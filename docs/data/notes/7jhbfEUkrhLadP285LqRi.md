When you draw down on your RRSP (ie. withdraw money from it), you lose the contribution room of the amount removed.

The max deduction limit is 18% of gross income previous year, up to $27,830

You donâ€™t have to deduct an RRSP contribution on your tax return in the same year you make the contribution. You can wait and deduct it in a future year. You may choose to do this if you think your income will be higher in the future, moving you up to a higher tax bracket. This is called having unused RRSP contributions.

Employer's contributions to the RRSP are able to be included as part of the RRSP contributions deduction.

RRSP deadline is March 1 2023.

Contribution room can be obtained from CRA Notice of Assessment (check mail within CRA portal)
