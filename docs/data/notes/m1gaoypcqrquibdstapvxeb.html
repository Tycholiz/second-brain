<p>A microphone converts sound waves into electrical waves</p>
<p>Consider the <a href="/notes/QaLilUKDt0ygef1KqjNE9#inverse-square-law-of-sound">Inverse Square law</a></p>
<p>note: <code>on-axis</code> refers to "where the microphone is pointing"</p>

<h3 id="dynamic-microphone">Dynamic Microphone<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#dynamic-microphone"></a></h3>
<p>Better for capturing loud, strong sounds, especially in a live setting</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. drums, guitar amps, loud vocals</li>
</ul>
<p>Dynamic microphones are older, and thus most primitive in terms of design</p>
<h3 id="condenser-microphone">Condenser Microphone<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#condenser-microphone"></a></h3>
<p>Better for capturing more delicate sounds and higher frequencies, especially in a studio setting.</p>
<p>Needs electricity to function (between 9V-48V), which can be supplied either via batteries in the microphone itself or <em>phantom power</em></p>
<ul>
<li>phantom power usually comes from an audio interface or pre-amp, and the switch would be labelled as <code>+48v</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="microphone-polar-patterns">Microphone Polar Patterns<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#microphone-polar-patterns"></a></h2>
<p>A microphone’s polar pattern is the 3-dimensional space surrounding the capsule where it is MOST sensitive to sound.</p>
<ul>
<li>this "sensitive area" is known as the <em>acceptance angle</em>, and can be defined as the angle before sensitivity drops by 3dB. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="omnidirectional">Omnidirectional<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#omnidirectional"></a></h3>
<p>equally sensitive to sound from all directions.</p>
<p>Good for overhead (OH) mics on drumkits</p>
<h3 id="bidirectional-figure-8">Bidirectional (Figure-8)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#bidirectional-figure-8"></a></h3>
<p>very sensitive to sound from the front and rear, but almost completely deaf on the sides.</p>
<h3 id="cardioid">Cardioid<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#cardioid"></a></h3>
<p>Cardioid mics have a wide acceptance angle of about 180°</p>
<ul>
<li>the signal strength drops only by 6dB on either side of the on-axis line.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of a cardioid mic is to record the sound of what it's pointed at and ignore everything else, making it useful especially for</p>
<ul>
<li>miking up drumkits</li>
<li>live performances</li>
<li>untreated rooms</li>
</ul>
<p>The downsides of a cardioid microphone is:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is a noticeable drop in high-frequency sensitivity as you move further away from where the microphone is pointing.</li>
<li><em>proximity effect</em>, whereby the bass freqencies are boosted when the sound source is too close to the microphone.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Generally speaking, cardioid and hypercardioid will perform better in reverberant spaces than shotguns or omnis"</p>
<p>Cardioid is a combination of omnidirectional and bidirectional</p>
<ul>
<li>sound signals coming from the front (on-axis) are 2x as strong</li>
<li>sound signals coming from the side are the same as omnidirectional (1x)</li>
<li>sound signals coming from the rear are cancelled out </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="supercardioid">Supercardioid<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#supercardioid"></a></h3>
<p>Supercardioid mics have a tighter acceptance angle than cardioids (about 150° compared to 180°)</p>
<ul>
<li>supercardioid mics are great choices for isolating individual sound sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Supercardioid mics are sensitive to vocal plosives (e.g. pops) and wind noise</p>
<p>Supercardioids are good microphones for close-miking in loud environments</p>
