<p>When someone asks you to do something that you don't want to do (e.g. give up seat on plane, sign up for PTA), sympathetically say "I'm sorry, I just can't". If pressed, repeat that it is "just impossible". If pressed further, just say "I'm sure I don't want to bore you with the details of my medical condition</p>
<p>If someone is doing something physical to you and you want to get them to stop, tell them you have a rule against what is going on</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. "I got a rule, no play-fighting with drunk dudes"</li>
</ul>
<p>try to keep your cool in conversations and take everything in a good-humoured way. In other words don't assume what they're saying to you is meant to be offensive. Smile, laugh and cheers your drink to them. It will allow you to maintain the upper hand. This will be good if someone makes a joke at your expense</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. Desperate Housewives, Orson's last night before prison. Everyone makes jokes at his expense, and he just laughs along with them and cheers them.</li>
</ul>
