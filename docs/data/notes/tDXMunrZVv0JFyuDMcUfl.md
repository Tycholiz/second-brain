Anger is a secondary emotion, in that it serves as socially acceptable mask for many of the more difficult underlying emotions that we feel

Anger. If you remove that word, you'll force yourself to search for a more appropriate word for the occasion, allowing yourself to explore how you really feel about that thing. is it hatred? or is it frustration, struggle, annoyance, difficulty...?
