Remember, the space between the notes in a staff do not correspond to distance in terms of semitone; only in terms of scale degree (e.g. 3rd, 5th)

## Landmark system
The landmark system is about memorizing a certain set of "special" notes: the landmark notes

Notice:
- Middle C is one ledger line *below* the treble clef, and one ledger line *above* the bass clef
  - in fact, any C note on one clef is located at the mirrored position of the other clef (middle C would be the mirror itself).
- The next 2 notes (Treble G and Bass F) are 4 notes away from middle C.
- The next 2 notes (Treble C and Bass C) are 3 notes away from Treble G and Bass F (respectively)

## Nmeumonics
one whole space up corresponds to a 3rd interval
- ex. one note on the line and another on the next line
- ex. one note in a space and another in the next space

- In the bass clef, the middle line is a `d`, which can be seen as a backward `b`, which is the middle line of the treble clef

- For treble clef, the hugging notes are `d`o`g`
- For bass clef, the hugging notes are `F`at `B`itch

- for treble clef, the 2 outside lines spell out `A`-`C`
- for bass clef, the 2 outside lines spell out `C`-`E`

- the note between the 2 outside lines is the same note as the middle line
  - treble: `b`
  - bass: `d`
