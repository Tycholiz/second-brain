<p>A coincident pair of microphones is a pair of microphones positioned with their capsules as close together as possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>"pair" means that we will be using 2 identical microphones, as well as having both mics run through the same preamp and with the same amount of gain.</li>
<li>The capsules are pointed in such a way that a stereo image is possible when panning each microphone. </li>
<li>There are several coincident pair techniques which are all stereo miking techniques, such as <em>XY</em> and <em>Blumlein</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Coincident pairs are utilized for capturing a stereo image of close sound sources, distant sound sources, and entire acoustic environments.</p>
<ul>
<li>Although coincident pairs may not be as wide as spaced pairs, the coincident nature of the microphone capsules eliminates many of the phasing issues inherent in spaced microphone pairs.</li>
</ul>

<p>An XY pair has two cardioid microphones (typically top-address pencil mics) positioned with their capsules together but pointing 90° to 135° from one another.</p>

<p>Place the one microphone 20cm out aimed at the soundboard (not the hole), with the SM57 20cm out aimed halfway up the neck. Pan them left and right respectively and record them as two mono channels.</p>
