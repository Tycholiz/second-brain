### Pomelos: Using Schemas to Aid in Explanation
- explain what a pomelo is in 2 ways: 
  1. A pomelo is the largest citrus fruit. The rind is very thick but soft and easy to peel away. The resulting fruit has a light yellow to coral pink flesh and can vary from juicy to slightly dry and from seductively spicy- sweet to tangy and tart
  2. A pomelo is basically a super sized grapefruit with a very thick and soft rind
  - which do you know more about?
  - the second explanation is stickier because we have used our existing grapefruit schema to help understand a new concept
  - this is analogous to object-oriented programming, in the sense that a grapefruit inherit certain properties, such as tanginess, citrus, acidic etc. When we say something is like a grapefruit, then that object we are describing inherits all of these properties, plus all of the ones that we specify afterwards. (Ex. It is like uber for hotels)

- the most basic way to get someone's attention is to break a pattern
  - humans adapt quickly to consistent patterns. Consistent and predictable patterns cause us to tune out

- Percentages are easier to understand than big numbers

- Use intuitive concepts when possible
  - ex. "...costs as much as a b-2 bomber" is not as relatable as "...costs as much as one soft drink per month"
