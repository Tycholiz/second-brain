waves are disturbances. They are the result of displacement of something
- ex. sound, ocean, electromagnetic

## Transverse vs. Longitudinal waves
- transverse - a wave where the oscillation occurs at a right angle to the direction of the sound
    - ex. when waves on the ocean move toward south, we have an up-down movement on the ocean's surface (ie. not north-south)
    - A transverse wave causes a particle to rise up and down, as it "rides the wave"
- longitudinal - the oscillation occurs in the same direction that the sound wave is moving in.
    - ex. when a sound wave moves south, the air molecules are being disturbed in only a southward or northward direction.
