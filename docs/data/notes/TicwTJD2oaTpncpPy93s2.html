<p>privilege isn't about having an easy life, it's about not having to consider those difficult questions that were posed</p>
<ul>
<li>questions like:
<ul>
<li>"will there be an elevator where we are going?"</li>
<li>"will people look at me weird when they see me holding hands with another man?"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
