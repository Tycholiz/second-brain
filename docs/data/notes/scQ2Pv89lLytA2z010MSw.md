Physics is the science of the fundamental features of the universe: matter, energy, time and space. They came into existence 13.5 billions of years ago

Released photons (i.e. light) carry momentum 
- if you were to turn on a flashlight in space, you would move slightly in the opposite direction

Temperature
- scientifically, temperature is the average motion of particals in an object. The faster they move, the hotter it is.
- therefore, there is no concept of hot or cold for a single particle.

It takes an unlimited amount of energy to travel the speed of light. Because of $E=MC^2$, the energy required increases with the *square* of the speed that we want to travel.
- This equation highlights an energy mass equivalence. As an object travels faster, its mass increases, making it more difficult to travel even faster.
- this effect is only significant for objects traveling close to the speed of light 
  - ex. At 10% the speed of light, an object has only a 0.5% increased mass. At 90% the speed of light, the mass has doubled

The building blocks of the physical world are up and down quirks, protons, neutrons, and electrons. These building blocks have properties of *mass*, *charge*, and *spin*. They have no concept of *size*, or *shape*.
