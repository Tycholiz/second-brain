Make sure you aren't relying on muscle memory. To check, cut the tempo by half and see if you can still play the scale properly.

## Fingering
Think not in terms of rote memorized fingerings but instead of the fact that crosses from black to white keys are better than black/black or white/white crosses. 
- You even say: the LH 4 goes on a black key nearly every time. It's not a coincidence that 4s are always crossing point in scales.

note: finger patterns show 2 octaves
