<p>Critical when using reference tracks is to level match</p>
<ul>
<li>typically, plugins will do this for us (Magic A/B etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>As part of the reference track notes we should have sections that kind of demonstrate my favourite artists and influences. Showcase things about them, like Elton John uses lots of percussion to drive music. That way, when I’m looking for inspiration and ideas, I can treat it like “problem solution”. I need more driving forward in an Elton John type song? Check out philedalphia freedom </p>
<p>Organize this document by highlighted instrument part, for example if I like the piano tone, vocals etc</p>
<ul>
<li>that way, we can come to this document if we are looking for a bass track to reference our own against. "This song will provide a good benchmark for a gritty Rush-like tone"</li>
</ul>
<p>Elton John uses lots of percussion to drive songs forward</p>
<p>One Horse Town - Elton John</p>
<ul>
<li>This song is a great example for using orchestral instruments to build energy and lead into a verse. Take note before the vocals come in, the low horns and strings work beautifully to finish off the intro and introduce the first verse</li>
</ul>
<p>Electric piano can be a good counterpoint to solo acoustic guitar </p>
<ul>
<li>ex. Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy</li>
</ul>
<p>Pay attention to the hammond organ on burn down the mission. Notice the role it plays</p>
