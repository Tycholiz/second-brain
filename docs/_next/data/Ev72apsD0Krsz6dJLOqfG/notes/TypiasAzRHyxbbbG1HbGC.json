Brass for example has a noticable delay between when the player starts to blow and sound actually comes out of the instrument. Therefore quantization will not work well automatically in these cases. What you need to do is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>record the midi part, playing by ear</li>\n<li>zoom in and gauge where the note is in relation to the official start of the bar. Does it appear before the start?
