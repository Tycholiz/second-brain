Wikipedia Table of Contents<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#4-wikipedia-table-of-contents\"></a></h4>\n<p>First, head over to Wikipedia and type in a broad keyword:\nThen, look for the “contents” section of the page.

Then, choose keywords based on what’s normal for your industry.</li>\n<li>organic link clicking is down due to:\n<ul>\n<li>ads taking top spots</li>\n<li>featured snippets</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Search volume only gives you part of the story. To get a full estimate of how many clicks you’ll get from a first page Google ranking, you also need to estimate organic CTR.\n<ul>\n<li>you can look at the SERPs (Search Engine Result Page) for your keyword.\n<ul>\n<li>If you see a lot of stuff on the first page (like a Featured Snippet and multiple Google Adwords ads), then you know that you’re not going to get a ton of clicks… even if you rank #1.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>With all that said, don't avoid a keyword just because it has a low CTR. If lots of people search for that term, it might still be worth going after.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"cpc\">CPC<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#cpc\"></a></h4>\n<p>CPC (cost per click) is a single metric that answers one important question:\nDo people searching for this keyword actually spend money?\nSo yeah, search volume is nice and all.\nBut if the person searching for that keyword is broke, then there’s no point in targeting that term. Plus, you can sometimes get a great ROI from a keyword that doesn’t get that many searches… if the CPC is high enough.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For example, one of my target keywords is “link building services”. According to the Google Keyword Planner, this keyword gets around 10-100 searches per month. So if I ONLY looked at search volume, I’d say: “This is a horrible keyword”. That’s why it’s super important to ALSO look at CPC. The CPC on that keyword is $7.15. Which means that people are spending $7.15 every time someone searching for that keyword clicks on an ad. So even though the search volume for that term isn’t that high, the CPC more than makes up for it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"likelihood-that-someone-clicking-on-your-link-will-become-a-paying-customer\">Likelihood that someone clicking on your link will become a paying customer<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#likelihood-that-someone-clicking-on-your-link-will-become-a-paying-customer\"></a></h5>\n<p>For example, a few weeks ago I came across the keyword: “backlink checker”. On the surface, this is a great keyword. It gets a decent amount of searches, And has a $4.01 CPC. But considering that I sell a YouTube training course, this term is a 10/10 in terms of business fit</p>\n<h5 id=\"keyword-trends\">Keyword Trends<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#keyword-trends\"></a></h5>\n<p>Finally, you want to see if your keyword is growing fast… or dying slow.</p>\n<p>And the best way to do that? Google Trends.</p>\n<p>For example, last year I was considering the keyword: “voice search SEO”.</p>\n<p>But I decided to pop that keyword into Google Trends before pulling the trigger.</p>\n<p>As you can see, interest in that keyword is growing fast. Which is why I optimized this page around that term. Even though that piece of content only brings in about 1k monthly search engine visitors per month today, the trend tells me that traffic to this post should increase over time.</p>\n<p>suppose you’re a web design company with a new plan to offer marketing services. You’re getting ready to launch the service and write a new, search optimized page for your own site. But should you call it: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>web marketing</li>\n<li>digital marketing</li>\n<li>internet marketing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Enter those three phrases into Google Trends and here’s what you’ll see Digital marketing is most trendy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Trends also shows geographic differences, which can be important if you’re targeting a local audience. Even though digital marketing is most popular, consider where the audience is.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"barnacle-seo\">Barnacle SEO<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#barnacle-seo\"></a></h5>\n<p>practice of using other sites’ authority to rank on the first page.\nBottom line? If you find an amazing keyword, you want to take up as much first page real estate as you can. First, create content on that topic on your own site. Then, publish keyword-optimized content on authority sites, like YouTube, LinkedIn, Medium and more.</p>\n<h5 id=\"gsc-keyword-research\">GSC Keyword Research<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#gsc-keyword-research\"></a></h5>\n<p>GSC > Performance Report</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This report shows you the terms that bring in the most clicks from Google search.</li>\n<li>sort the list by “Impressions”.\n<ul>\n<li>This shows you keywords that get lots of impressions… but not necessarily clicks</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Finally, create a piece of content optimized around that same keyword.\n<ul>\n<li>These are keywords that you KNOW people are searching for. You also know that Google sees your site as a good fit in the search results. You just need to publish content that’s super focused on that specific keyword (or optimize a piece of existing content around that keyword) and you’re set.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"optimize-content-around-synonyms-and-related-keywords\">Optimize Content around Synonyms and Related Keywords<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#optimize-content-around-synonyms-and-related-keywords\"></a></h5>\n<p>If you are optimizing for \"build backlinks\", sprinkle throughout your content \"get backlinks\" and \"generate backlinks\"</p>\n<h5 id=\"ahrefs-content-gap\">Ahrefs Content Gap<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#ahrefs-content-gap\"></a></h5>\n<ul>\n<li>use Ahrefs to see the exact keywords another site ranks for.\n<ul>\n<li>Head over to Ahrefs content gap. And put in 2-3 competing sites.</li>\n<li>This will show you keywords that at least 2 of your competitors rank for… but you don’t.</li>\n<li>And because multiple competitors rank for these terms, you know that you also have a good chance of cracking the top 10.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"navigational-keywords-avoid-these\">Navigational keywords (avoid these)<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#navigational-keywords-avoid-these\"></a></h5>\n<ul>\n<li>people searching for \"ahrefs\" are most likely looking for <a href=\"http://www.ahrefs.com\">www.ahrefs.com</a></li>\n<li>this means that very few people click on anything but the first result</li>\n<li>so a particular keyword may look great, but this wouldnt be a good keyword to optimize for, as you will not get much traffic compared to the first result.</li>\n<li>This is why focusing on <em>searcher intent</em> is so important</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"find-shoulder-keywords\">Find “Shoulder Keywords”<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#find-shoulder-keywords\"></a></h5>\n<p>Most people ONLY optimize their site around keywords that are very closely related to what they sell.</p>\n<p>And it’s a BIG mistake for two main reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Keywords that people use to find your products are usually super competitive.</li>\n<li>There are thousands of keywords that your potential customer searches for when they’re not searching for that you sell.\nFor example, like I mentioned earlier, I run an SEO training company.\nBut I don’t optimize every page on my site around commercial terms. (Like “SEO training” and “SEO courses”). Instead, I rank for keywords that my customers search for when they’re not looking for SEO training. (Keywords like: “link building”, “on-page SEO” and “SEO Tools”).\nthese keywords are “Shoulder Keywords”.\nThese keywords aren’t directly related to what you sell. But they’re keywords that your customers search for. Which makes them worth going after.\n-Let’s say you run an Ecommerce site that sells basketball hoops. Obviously, you’d want to optimize some of your pages around terms like “buy basketball hoops online”. But don’t stop there. After all, someone interested in buying a basketball hoop may also search for: </li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>How to shoot a better free throw</li>\n<li>Slam dunk highlights</li>\n<li>How to get recruited by college scouts</li>\n<li>Nutrition for basketball players</li>\n<li>How to improve a vertical jump</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"evaluate-top-industry-websites\">evaluate top industry websites<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#evaluate-top-industry-websites\"></a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>find the topics/KWs that are in their menus, footers</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"faq-keyword-research\">FAQ keyword research<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#faq-keyword-research\"></a></h4>\n<p>AnswerThePublic.com</p>\n<ol>\n<li>export to csv and delete non relevant KWs</li>\n<li>Search and filter “display keyword suggestions” by “are questions”</li>\n<li>Add relevant questions from answerthepublic.com to a new keyword list in Moz Keyword Suggestions</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>don't worry about evaluating search volume too closely for FAQs because questions are typically more long-tail</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"competitive-content-research\">Competitive content research<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#competitive-content-research\"></a></h4>\n<p>similarweb.com - Evaluate your competitor’s 10 most popular pages</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This uncovers the specific type of content your audience is interested in</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Evaluate each of the top pages &#x26; gather 3 key takeaways</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>example\n<ul>\n<li>The most popular “<a href=\"http://www.example.com/gallery%E2%80%9D\">www.example.com/gallery”</a> page confirms that images are extremely popular in the wedding and event space.

Typically in these cases, the page has stronger relevance. That page (or that entire website) is totally focused on the topic.</p>\n<p>Authority is important, but it’s not everything. There are many other search ranking factors.\nHere is the general rule:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the Domain Authority of your site is within the range of the domain authorities of the other, high-ranking websites, you should have a chance of ranking for the phrase. If not, go back and look for a longer, more specific, less popular but less competitive phrase.\n<ul>\n<li>Note: Page Authority, not Domain Authority is the real test. Ultimately, it’s the authority of our page versus the authority of their page.</li>\n<li>But when we are making a new page targeting a new phrase, we don’t have a page authority to compare to! So use Domain Authority as a more general guide when creating new content and Page Authority when adjusting keyphrases and optimizing existing content.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here’s a simple way to research keywords fast. You can estimate your odds of ranking based on your Domain Authority and the keyword search volume or just number of words in the phrase. This is oversimplified for sure, but it may help give you an idea for what general range you should be in.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If domain authority is...\n<ul>\n<li>&#x3C; 30, target keyphrases with  less than 100 searches/mo OR keyphrases of length = 5 words</li>\n<li>&#x3C; 50, target keyphrases with less than 1000 searches/mo OR keyphrase of length = 4 words</li>\n<li>&#x3C; 70, target keyphrases with less than 3000 searches/mo OR keyphrase of length = 3 words</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"expand-your-keyword-reach-with-mozbar\">Expand your keyword reach with MozBar<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#expand-your-keyword-reach-with-mozbar\"></a></h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Activate MozBar.

Here you'll find thoughts, lessons, facts and any other interesting musings that I've come across or thought up over the years. A lot of what I have gathered over the years are originally from the minds of others, while some are my own. Some may be outdated and no longer reflect my current views. Some may contain misinformation, though I try to be rigorous with my additions.
