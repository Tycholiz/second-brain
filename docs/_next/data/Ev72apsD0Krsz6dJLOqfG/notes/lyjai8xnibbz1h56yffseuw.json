Atoms of any given element can come in different versions called isotopes, which have differing number of neutrons, but always the same number of protons.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in other words, an element can have different numbers of neutrons. These different instances are known as isotopes. </li>\n<li>because different isotopes of an element are differentiated by their number of neutrons, therefore the atomic mass varies between these isotopes</li>\n<li>ex. Carbon-12 is an isotope of 6 protons and 6 neutrons. Carbon-14 is an isotope of 6 protons and 8 neutrons</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some isotopes are stable and some are unstable.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. Lead-202 is an unstable isotope, while lead-204, lead-206, lead-207 and lead-208 are stable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unstable means that the atoms spontaneously decay into something else at a predictable rate (though the decay occurs at unpredictable moments)</p>\n<p>Another word for unstable is radioactive</p>\n<p>In one kind of isotope instability, a neutron turns into a proton. This means that the mass number stays the same, but the atomic number goes up, so the atom becomes a different element.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in another type of radioactive decay, the opposite happens</li>\n<li>Every unstable isotope decays at its own characteristic rate which is precisely known. </li>\n<li>decay is exponential\n<ul>\n<li>ex. Starting with 100 grams of a radioactive isotope, a fixed proportion of the remaining amount will decay. For example, if that proportion was 10%, then it would start at 100g, then 90g, then 81g, and so on.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"half-life\">Half-life<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#half-life\"></a></h3>\n<p>The favoured measure of decay rate is the half-life, which is the time taken for half of the atoms to decay </p>\n<ul>\n<li>the half-life is the same, no matter how many atoms have already decayed (that is what exponential decay means)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The half-life of carbon-14 is between 5000 and 6000 years. Therefore, for specimens older than about 50,000 to 60,000 years, carbon dating is useless. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>the half-life of rubidium-87 is 49 billion years; the half-life of fermium-244 is 3.3 milliseconds. Such startling extremes show us the stupendous range of clocks available. </li>\n<li>potassium-40 has a half life of 1.26 billion years, and is therefore an isotope much used on the evolutionary timescale.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An isotope decaying means it turns into another element</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. Potassium-40 has a half life of 1.26B years. One element below potassium is argon. If we start with some quantity of potassium, after 1.26 billion years, half of the potassium-40 will have decayed to argon-40. After another 1.26 billion years, half of what remains (ie a quarter of the original) will have decayed, and so on.</li>\n<li>Therefore, we now understand how isotopes can be used as our clock. If we took a pound of potassium-40 and put it in a sealed box and waited for a few hundred million years, we would find that some proportion of those original potassium-40 atoms are now argon-40. By measuring the proportions, we can conclude how much time as elapsed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"link-rot\">Link rot<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#link-rot\"></a></h4>\n<p>A 2003 study found that on the Web, about one link out of every 200 broke each week, suggesting a half-life of 138 weeks.</p>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/gwwbbsvetmybs1irj0r9xid\">Carbon</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"8qvi4S0Dk1BAaCLhfHqAp","title":"Second Brain","desc":"","updated":1672111562730,"created":1616360437888,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"../main/thoughts-on","name":"thoughts-on"},"contentHash":"dd394dade3f08feaa5cf4d1caeb1c991","links":[],"anchors":{"tags":{"type":"header","text":"Tags","value":"tags","line":12,"column":0,"depth":3}},"children":["8aPvLrwcPnxcTwx7PdvXW","l9ldUruxqRBZwMij5KlS5","xWh3SS0J1hvRSZ7g4LvEE","cc5kdn5ay8omhcud9hjfpyk","9jNuGCXVuFaZOGZfLpKi5","mhlpKRrfT0qlXzTaapFYZ","QU1tbQ4KX64UBCWtCxAcR","U4tQLU5tRHqr9e7H3G4Gm","PvcIkEJcDtcv7luF2mBIU","2wW5Kxk794H9mfnu9VPA8","iwANjkbi3nbIovlVpepWm","XYgvsgvjzgoyvY6KAEu5Y","pT9wnWnS42pFId9UIH5he","gmXZ6Xy8f8FFQ66Z5DYqh","CjV6QXVHIqQTuZTSlSSlB","IgbLitAU1k0ioGhuvmjjS","D42jFbx0vNlT7S6QRb5ee","dFs5zopMmrh3rPgQaSkyP","W0AgEfoTzJ8VxVE4QqhSL","ggU4P3K1OhUlHBJbpgHiD","vtu2srTzCfoNUHv0Xcbxn","6kuwlrc3PT5JoQS9xZWZW","qoZ6e9KsYPestYFpO4Ce4","GPH8BieqB4dtqul80gJvX","MbW1wF5mIZ7g3DPXrOSyZ","Ay9vOAmvV8ODJFpaEkw6J","8Pi3wPs4LTxlAEOUE48Te","SDd8268l79j2cnvCVVl8F","zI5rK8mFkNghzLgbQD6ox","zCwMY5ckgKAqstOhw2Drd","i5Fya3Vzzm0rBT0ctByuo","YDbL8QXchj03NvTIZOdrk","km4fy13hx9puopyjr1ajdgj","WdAyuDkIi16pl1pnaopzx","15ax6k6x106sotobkyn3jqp","sgu2QxqDGup93hJPx8RJd","mT663nw5DUEaEGzXI98yD","Dyg6bFtxE0UkB7gz6pqzq","cn1x9vhdapyt1fvgtvfekea","0aYhvzCfaIxLaNhqNCV9Q","q9NskCGxFGNQwBDcsgNkY","wAdoBPUMHEFJkm6XVlHXW","sCYBuXnSNA259MDwhakmv","YgQusR9D6RbBgdkLuJuDh","ovHaNSb3tnl2LTdV7wwau","eqklm05q2g46ikqaqv9ijh9","8TJC5FfwKtfmH4GfOZVoO","9rKIOn3BV7ZU1FFlJxmvC","rsrE9vBXK0ehNkbEjltlZ","XTkKLi0Jg1imZ2lbhgOrv","4Fuw6OHQ5uhEVCUfXDfkb","pUEyedPYYlNSVLuiUSnge","KtoCw0HFEddGJ7GuW7GnN","BoxZ36iWEbUoRProxPo4D","gCmclfAHAt1tEcFDc24eD","TNhxyx7GEdGDM0PBI08b1","guyW7WWQNDGDALFV7tO57","YeEWZtb7FWvYTyJwF7zhR","DUrXQvolf76ILMKJm4Zt6","Jo4jAQcwgxsdxkcxUceR4","X6yPFUKIjs6tENQ3uNzE2","aRSv8qoJLyeE6xDAAUYpU","jwb0toyj23byc7krttp0l8k","ztqrUgUYssC0FAWDGZxWF","d7evrjgli013nul3mosquea","mvBLIZW424WZ5mCmjKQaB","YoV6c5CmpHYNEuYU4PsgH","JQzF2iPfQ2897j6HFCoY9","TicwTJD2oaTpncpPy93s2","KiGGs6PmvIlIt50r2tF2O","4TiqSFRd4hD0e5tyHbf4d","8F9H6GIButHtrFKXHzZFu","t5CaAEDQFRutGrV0ru97d","het26IMKUnKB7npru8tG4","GgRKYXklrXEAs9u15sOM9","PPvKHQNulUEvXEitqAZxM","SMGOfSTElTkJBezhNvkZ6","358nLIVsR9zmItfuBCWq2","xewZxeuhzI7qMvoYdcnLM","FAAtgk8cbuownxuv0Vlou","64N1mdh3JWL1WOv1dilYD","aCd3q2zSzgQnHKi1vOJFj","kh7Y1bQw7Om31yurE4CrW","5162x506d5mgwkn07plcuo3","LGnyEtwA1LlztJJwEpg6l","zoJRWH59vBCpqnm8fOpis","xlg9pngfxviby5z2qfcfpcv","G6zDrHf3Ua8R7vllalBc5","NrjfBxxDU92ByYSIJjgDM","zNcMG5nj1t69zkAFnvn5S","JIHQPGBUDqAEPzbhfFxlc","MmjHaByLtYx5sv2HzXnWd"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nWelcome to my Second Brain!
