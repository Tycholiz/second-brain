A $15 shovel sold for $20 following a snow storm will have the consumers perceiving a $5 loss imposed by the store. If you want to pull this off, you'd have to change the consumers reference point somehow, preventing them from anchoring themselves to the $15</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Upward inflections in the voice are an excellent way to de-escalate conflict.\nDownward inflection implies you are taking more control of the situation, and people In a fiery mood tend to respond aggressively when they feel you are trying to control them</p>\n<p>You are communicating that you're on the same side as someone else when you can laugh with them</p>\n<p>it's okay to let them know how much you like the product but never let them know how much you like the price</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if you go to her house Erie like it's great to point out things you like about the house but just be careful to say what you think about the price</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When negotiating with someone you have to find something that you agree on </p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. After a flight cancellation without any kind of compensation, you can find common ground that the airline have done more. How can they disagree on that? Then you go from there.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>when trying to persuade someone to concede something to you in negotiation, get them to think about the type of client that they <em>would</em> concede that item to. Once this image of a client is in their mind, plant the position of yourself with respect to that ideal client.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. in negotiating with Telus to get the 3 months remaining on contract thrown out....\n<ol>\n<li>first find out if it is at all possible to achieve.</li>\n<li>ask \"what separates me from this ideal client?\"</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>this causes them to push their image of you closer to that picture of the ideal client </li>\n<li>this technique works because people naturally don't want to concede, and they believe their thinking is rational. This forces them to be more rational.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When negotiating, never start a clock, because it gives the other side the opportunity to make the wrong decision</p>\n<p>It's easier to negotiate when you don't have the final power on something. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. consider the Netflix series Waco, where the FBI negotiator has the ability to connect with David Koresh, based on his conveyance that \"we are in the same boat here. I'm trying to end this peacefully, just as you are\". he has the ability to show that he is a reasonable negotiator, and not let the limits imposed on him from his bosses negate that sentiment. </li>\n<li>when negotiating, look for a way to \"blame\" a higher limiting power to allow you to retain your image as a reasonable negotiator</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"fairness\">Fairness<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#fairness\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fairness is fundamental to what we are as humans, so it often comes up during a negotiation.</li>\n<li>Tell the other side: \"It's my intention to treat you fairly. If at any point in time I've been unfair, let me know. We'll go back and address it and fix it.\"\n<ul>\n<li>be proactive with this (before they've experienced unfairness). Otherwise nothing will be said, and their feelings of having been unjustly treated will blow up on you.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>by making declarations that the person is likely not to agree with 100%, you put them on the defensive. However, if we are able to put the ball in their court, then we force them to imagine the question, and are more likely to be honest with themselves.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>there is an incentive for the other party to answer truthfully to this question as well, as if they have not succeeded in what they set out to do, failing for lack of trying is much preferable to failing for lack of competence.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"ue-resources\">UE Resources<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#ue-resources\"></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.masterclass.com/articles/negotiation-strategies-from-former-hostage-negotiator-chris-voss\">https://www.masterclass.com/articles/negotiation-strategies-from-former-hostage-negotiator-chris-voss</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"related\">Related<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#related\"></a></h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/nkBdttR6V0w2dZ2tR8TYX#negotiation\">Persuasion</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"8qvi4S0Dk1BAaCLhfHqAp","title":"Second Brain","desc":"","updated":1672111562730,"created":1616360437888,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"../main/thoughts-on","name":"thoughts-on"},"contentHash":"dd394dade3f08feaa5cf4d1caeb1c991","links":[],"anchors":{"tags":{"type":"header","text":"Tags","value":"tags","line":12,"column":0,"depth":3}},"children":["8aPvLrwcPnxcTwx7PdvXW","l9ldUruxqRBZwMij5KlS5","xWh3SS0J1hvRSZ7g4LvEE","cc5kdn5ay8omhcud9hjfpyk","9jNuGCXVuFaZOGZfLpKi5","mhlpKRrfT0qlXzTaapFYZ","QU1tbQ4KX64UBCWtCxAcR","U4tQLU5tRHqr9e7H3G4Gm","PvcIkEJcDtcv7luF2mBIU","2wW5Kxk794H9mfnu9VPA8","iwANjkbi3nbIovlVpepWm","XYgvsgvjzgoyvY6KAEu5Y","pT9wnWnS42pFId9UIH5he","gmXZ6Xy8f8FFQ66Z5DYqh","CjV6QXVHIqQTuZTSlSSlB","IgbLitAU1k0ioGhuvmjjS","D42jFbx0vNlT7S6QRb5ee","dFs5zopMmrh3rPgQaSkyP","W0AgEfoTzJ8VxVE4QqhSL","ggU4P3K1OhUlHBJbpgHiD","vtu2srTzCfoNUHv0Xcbxn","6kuwlrc3PT5JoQS9xZWZW","qoZ6e9KsYPestYFpO4Ce4","GPH8BieqB4dtqul80gJvX","MbW1wF5mIZ7g3DPXrOSyZ","Ay9vOAmvV8ODJFpaEkw6J","8Pi3wPs4LTxlAEOUE48Te","SDd8268l79j2cnvCVVl8F","zI5rK8mFkNghzLgbQD6ox","zCwMY5ckgKAqstOhw2Drd","i5Fya3Vzzm0rBT0ctByuo","YDbL8QXchj03NvTIZOdrk","km4fy13hx9puopyjr1ajdgj","WdAyuDkIi16pl1pnaopzx","15ax6k6x106sotobkyn3jqp","sgu2QxqDGup93hJPx8RJd","mT663nw5DUEaEGzXI98yD","Dyg6bFtxE0UkB7gz6pqzq","cn1x9vhdapyt1fvgtvfekea","0aYhvzCfaIxLaNhqNCV9Q","q9NskCGxFGNQwBDcsgNkY","wAdoBPUMHEFJkm6XVlHXW","sCYBuXnSNA259MDwhakmv","YgQusR9D6RbBgdkLuJuDh","ovHaNSb3tnl2LTdV7wwau","eqklm05q2g46ikqaqv9ijh9","8TJC5FfwKtfmH4GfOZVoO","9rKIOn3BV7ZU1FFlJxmvC","rsrE9vBXK0ehNkbEjltlZ","XTkKLi0Jg1imZ2lbhgOrv","4Fuw6OHQ5uhEVCUfXDfkb","pUEyedPYYlNSVLuiUSnge","KtoCw0HFEddGJ7GuW7GnN","BoxZ36iWEbUoRProxPo4D","gCmclfAHAt1tEcFDc24eD","TNhxyx7GEdGDM0PBI08b1","guyW7WWQNDGDALFV7tO57","YeEWZtb7FWvYTyJwF7zhR","DUrXQvolf76ILMKJm4Zt6","Jo4jAQcwgxsdxkcxUceR4","X6yPFUKIjs6tENQ3uNzE2","aRSv8qoJLyeE6xDAAUYpU","jwb0toyj23byc7krttp0l8k","ztqrUgUYssC0FAWDGZxWF","d7evrjgli013nul3mosquea","mvBLIZW424WZ5mCmjKQaB","YoV6c5CmpHYNEuYU4PsgH","JQzF2iPfQ2897j6HFCoY9","TicwTJD2oaTpncpPy93s2","KiGGs6PmvIlIt50r2tF2O","4TiqSFRd4hD0e5tyHbf4d","8F9H6GIButHtrFKXHzZFu","t5CaAEDQFRutGrV0ru97d","het26IMKUnKB7npru8tG4","GgRKYXklrXEAs9u15sOM9","PPvKHQNulUEvXEitqAZxM","SMGOfSTElTkJBezhNvkZ6","358nLIVsR9zmItfuBCWq2","xewZxeuhzI7qMvoYdcnLM","FAAtgk8cbuownxuv0Vlou","64N1mdh3JWL1WOv1dilYD","aCd3q2zSzgQnHKi1vOJFj","kh7Y1bQw7Om31yurE4CrW","5162x506d5mgwkn07plcuo3","LGnyEtwA1LlztJJwEpg6l","zoJRWH59vBCpqnm8fOpis","xlg9pngfxviby5z2qfcfpcv","G6zDrHf3Ua8R7vllalBc5","NrjfBxxDU92ByYSIJjgDM","zNcMG5nj1t69zkAFnvn5S","JIHQPGBUDqAEPzbhfFxlc","MmjHaByLtYx5sv2HzXnWd"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nWelcome to my Second Brain!
