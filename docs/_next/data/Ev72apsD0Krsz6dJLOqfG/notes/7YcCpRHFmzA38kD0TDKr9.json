Carrying on, to get MA of <code>Year4</code> we calculate the averages from <code>Year2</code> to <code>Year6</code>. This is how we derive the trend line.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Typical periods: 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200, but these really are arbitrary.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Moving averages filter out the “noise” from random short-term price fluctuations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>From a technical perspective, the MA is used to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>identify trends\n<ul>\n<li>if price > MA, upward trend</li>\n<li>if price &#x3C; MA, downward trend</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>identify support (floor) and resistance (ceiling) levels\n<ul>\n<li>More technical traders set stop losses at Moving Average-current price differentials (ie. they find the stop-loss point by subtracting the MA from the current price). When the current price crosses the MA, it indicates the occurrence of a sell-off or buy-in</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>MAs with shorter time frames will react more sharply to price fluctuations</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Therefore, the lower the MA period, the closer the MA will track the actual stock price.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As a rule of thumb, the longer your horizon is, the longer the period of MA you will use.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is because when you have a long-term view on a stock, you are more accepting of medium-term (~3-6 months) downturn periods.\n<ul>\n<li>If you were to choose the wrong period, you would notice that you would be inclined to sell on premature hints of a downturn. In other words, you wouldn't be as willing to \"weather the storm\"\n<ul>\n<li>This means that generally, volatility reduces the relevance of the MA. You pick a longer period to offset the amount that you \"care\" about volatility (remember: volatility only can exist in the context of a time-period, since a short-term trader sees a 5% daily swing as much more volatile a movement than an investor would view it). </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Longer MAs by nature have longer lag times, which impacts when we will consider something to be uptrend of downtrend. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>This makes sense, because \"trend\" only makes sense in the context of a time period. A long-term investor is more tolerant of midterm \"downtrends\", but to him, they don't matter because he is looking overall, and asking \"what is the stock generally doing\"? </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"crossover\">Crossover<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#crossover\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If you plot a short MA and a long MA together, you may be able to forecast an upcoming downward trend for the stock\n<pre><code>- Again, the MA periods you choose depend on your investment horizon. If you are looking at long-term, then you should use longer period MAs. Ultimately, all investors should want to \"sell before a downtrend and buy before an uptrend\". Which trends matter is the question that you have to answer. Is this stock a long-term play? very-long-term? medium-long-term? \n</code></pre>\n<img src=\"/:/0323e32f98e949a6a68f67b6f4ecabab\" alt=\"f09b5d795314bc9bf3e481a4fabfb05b.png\"></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exponential-moving-average-ema\">Exponential Moving Average (EMA)<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#exponential-moving-average-ema\"></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>more for intra-day traders</li>\n<li>gives more weight to more recent prices</li>\n<li>Therefore, it reacts more sharply to price changes than a SMA</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"moving-average-convergence-divergence-macd\">Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD)<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#moving-average-convergence-divergence-macd\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>shows relationship between 2 different moving averages\n<ul>\n<li>12-period EMA minus 26-period EMA</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>a 9-day EMA of the MACD (signal line) is plotted on graph\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Crossover</strong> - if MACD crosses above the signal line, it is a buying signal.
