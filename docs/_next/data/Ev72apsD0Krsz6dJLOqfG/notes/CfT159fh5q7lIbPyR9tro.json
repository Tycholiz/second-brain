We would think of entropy as the deck of cards scattered everywhere, which is why we consider at disordered. But in reality, order here just means what we define order is in relation to a deck of cards.</p>\n<p>Consider that when you were holding a deck of cards cleanly in your hand, there Are much fewer ways to hold the deck of cards than there are ways for the cards to be strewn about all over the floor</p>\n<p>Entropy therefore is not about disorder, but it’s about how many ways something can happen in</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The more ways that something can happen in, the more entropy there is</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whenever we increase the volume of something, There are more states that the particles within that volume can be in, which is increasing its entropy</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. Imagine we have two containers of different sizes, but with the same amount of water vapour inside. The bigger container (or the more volumetric one) Will allow the water particles inside to have more states that they can possibly exist in.
