id=\"math\">Math<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#math\"></a></h1>\n<p>At its most fundamental level, math is the manipulation of symbols that represent numbers. The existence of symbols (ie. variables) is precisely what makes mathematics applicable to a wide range of areas.</p>\n<p>\"Math has a tendency to reward you when you respect its symmetries.\"</p>\n<p>Mathematics includes the study of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/r4E87onJ9XPCDkeh3rLng\">Arithmetic</a>, number theory</li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/qx2jqwy8tbnzw796i0e6hls\">Algebra</a> - functions and related structures</li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/koG9prpJ5OJGA9mhBfs72\">Geometry</a> - shapes and spaces in which they are contained</li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/TBATXjmhVgnvCDmR1mVuD\">Calculus</a>, analysis - quantities and their changes</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"why-learn-math\">Why learn math?<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#why-learn-math\"></a></h2>\n<p>We don't learn things like integrals so that we can use them in everyday life. Instead, we learn them and practice them for the same reason that a soccer player does zig-zag drills and lifts weights. You will never see them do those things on the soccer field, but they will use the strength, speed, insight and flexibility that they built up by doing those drills. Therefore, learning those drills is a part of soccer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>And if we don't want to be our proverbial professional soccer player, that's fine! We can still enjoy a game of soccer with friends, and we will be healthier for doing so. Mathematics is the same way. You may not be aiming for a a math-focused career, but math is woven into the way we reason. Knowing mathematics is like wearing X-ray specs that reveal hidden structures underneath the messy and chaotic surface of the world.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We learn math because it influences our habits of thought. In this sense, it is no different from learning about <a href=\"/notes/YvUebpCLQthh4RjKLGGzF\">biases</a> and <a href=\"/notes/6b515083-9466-403e-85f4-0a12006a2cbd\">fallacies</a>: they help us recognize patterns in the world and influence our decision-making for the better.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>someone well-versed in math is always asking: \"what assumptions are you making? And why are they justified?\"\n<ul>\n<li>ex. someone unfamiliar with <a href=\"/notes/2zadm09v1o7hl6ot3bh67tk\">Survivorship Bias</a> will hear a story like <a href=\"/notes/2zadm09v1o7hl6ot3bh67tk#abraham-walds-airplane-bullet-holes\">Abraham Wald's Aircraft Bullet Holes</a> and will make a set of assumptions. Their naive assumption is that all planes are returning from battle, and that is therefore the denominator in their calculation. Of course, this isn't true, and it causes them to reach a very wrong conclusion.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\"math is like an atomic-powered prosthesis that you attach to your common sense, vastly multiplying its reach and strength\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"abstraction\">Abstraction<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#abstraction\"></a></h3>\n<p>Mathematics is all about abstraction. We observe the fingers on our hand and abstract over them the concept of natural numbers. We see how you can take away values from a set and abstract out the concept of negation. We take the concepts of numbers, addition, and negation and abstract them to groups. And so on, and so on.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>\"Mathematicians don't just care about finding the answer but developing general problem solving tools and techniques.\"</em></li>\n<li>It's all about boiling down specific applications to their most basic and fundamental properties.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To be an effective at math, you need to be able to look past all of the empirical application of the problem you are trying to solve and understand the fundamental mathematics that lies behind. In this sense, we focus on the common skeleton shared by different problems that look very different on the surface.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. if you are able to do this, it becomes apparent when <a href=\"/notes/YvUebpCLQthh4RjKLGGzF\">biases</a> are being assumed.</li>\n<li>sometimes only paying attention to the abstract part of the problem can cause you to ignore features of the problem that really matter</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"the-problem-with-how-math-is-taught\">The problem with how math is taught<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#the-problem-with-how-math-is-taught\"></a></h3>\n<p>In school, math is taught as a set of rules that one must obey or you fail. But this is not mathematics. Mathematics is the study of things that come out in a certain way because there is no other way they could possibly be.</p>\n<h3 id=\"intuitiveness-of-math\">Intuitiveness of math<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#intuitiveness-of-math\"></a></h3>\n<p>As humans, we have built-in mental systems for assessing the likelihood of an uncertain outcome. But past rudimentary mathematics, those systems are pretty weak and unreliable (especially when it comes to events of extreme rarity).</p>\n<p>Addition is the most fundamental of mathematics and also the most intuitive.
