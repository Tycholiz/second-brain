This is a logical fallacy because it demonstrates a cause and effect that may only exist for those with access to those 2+ facts side by side</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. \n<ol>\n<li>I worked 7 days/week for several months </li>\n<li>I take a weekday off and don't get paid for it. </li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>If looking at these statements together, there is a sense of injustice delivered by the hands of the person who refused to pay.
