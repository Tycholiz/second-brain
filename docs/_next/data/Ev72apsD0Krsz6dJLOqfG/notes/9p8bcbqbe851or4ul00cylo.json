If this process takes >100ms, it will be noticeable.</li>\n<li>in a video editor, our input to the program is to make edits.

However, a shorter buffer means that the other elements of the system must be correspondingly more efficient in order to ensure that the CPU isn't locked up for too long (recall that CPUs multitask and handle many different requests seemingly at the same time, but actually does so sequentially)\n<ul>\n<li>\"other elements\" here might consist of, video cards, audio interfaces, network interfaces (espectially wireless interfaces), USB controllers, disk controllers\n<ul>\n<li>often the problem lies in a video card or sound card, which is why installing new drivers is normally the first thing to do when a performance issue like this arises.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>by increasing the audio buffer size, we are essentially increasing the window of opportunity for the CPU to fill it.\n<ul>\n<li>therefore, if we are having pops and crackles that are caused by devices that deliver audio files to the computer, increasing the buffer size is essentially slowing down the train to give the CPU a chance deliver all of the expected audio data on time.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When a problem device (e.g. audio interface/driver) locks up the CPU, the DAW can't properly fill each buffer, the audio data has a gap in it, or worse, a garbled mess of random data. As the sound card receives this corrupted data, this is manifested as pops, clicks, crackles</p>\n<ul>\n<li>other times, the computer will just put everything on pause until the buffer is filledâ€” in which case playback will produce a stutter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/2022-09-13-14-39-28.png\"></p>\n<p>spec: an audio buffer size can be measured in ms or mb.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if my buffer is 200ms it means that it will</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"fixing-problems-related-to-cracklingpopping\">Fixing problems related to crackling/popping<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#fixing-problems-related-to-cracklingpopping\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>check for latest drivers (note: the latest driver is not always the best for your system.)</li>\n<li>Ensure buffer size is not too small.\n<ul>\n<li>the more tracks in your project, the higher your buffer needs to be</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ensure that sampling rate is not too high.
