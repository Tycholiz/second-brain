Because availability of storage is so inelastic, such a scenario can lead to a gnarly game of musical chairs. And that’s exactly what happened on April 20th 2020, a month into the U.S. Covid-19 pandemic lockdown. Demand for oil dropped so precipitously that oil holders suddenly found themselves scrambling for storage depots. When storage ran out, those still holding barrels had no choice but to pay people to take their oil, causing the price of oil to go negative. Yes, really, the West Texas Intermediate oil benchmark closed at -$37.63.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In every recent recession there has been a permanent loss in jobs</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex.
