Here you'll find thoughts, lessons, facts and any other interesting musings that I've come across or thought up over the years. A lot of what I have gathered over the years are originally from the minds of others, while some are my own. Some may be outdated and no longer reflect my current views. Some may contain misinformation, though I try to be rigorous with my additions. You can think of it as my personal wiki.\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [Tech-focused Digital Garden](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com)\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the Second Brain, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual.
