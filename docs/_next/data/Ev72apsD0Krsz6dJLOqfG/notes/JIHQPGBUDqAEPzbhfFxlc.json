I will work out daily. I won't eat cake after dinner. I want to be strong and have lots of energy</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prefrontal cortex is where will, won't and want operate. When at full capacity they do a good job. But it is vulnerable to distraction, fatigue, desire, being drunk etc.  Ex. Phineas Gage </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To maximize willpower, try to be fully in the moment Expl. Being distracted depletes in the moment willpower</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>People are more likely to be influenced by empty persuasive messages, such as commercials, when they are tired and depleted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The ultimate destination should not be “losing 10 pounds,” it should be something intrinsically motivating, such as “Fitting into my sexy black pants</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you can link something hard to a choice you care about, it makes the task easier</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. Getting the motivation to go workout every day is difficult, but creating a mental link between being able to work harder and smarter with more energy is something I care about, so it makes the task of working out easier</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The self-control of morning people is impaired at night; the reverse is true of night people.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The list of situations and tasks that are now known to deplete self-control is long and varied. All involve conflict and the need to suppress a natural tendency.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fight or flight causes your body to suppress impulse control, as all physical and mental energy is directed towards survival</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Anything causing stress on mind or body will reduce reserve of willpower</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stress encourages focus into the short term goals and outcomes, while self control requires you to keep the big picture in mind</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Slow down breathing to 4-6 breaths per minute. This shifts the body from stress to self control mode</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fatigue takes place in the mind, not the body. It is a signal from our brain telling us to stop exerting physical effort, like anxiety tells us to be careful and disgust tells us not to eat that thing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The implication is that feeling fatigue isn't a sign that you will just keel over imminently.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tip: imagine how easy it will be to resist that chocolate bar 1 year from now with one years worth of practice</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If your desire for having more willpower (not yell during fights) isn't working, try rethinking what your desire should be. Maybe your desire should be \"be happier in the relationship\"</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Most of the things that make us feel bad about doing something inspire some sort of <em>ick</em> feeling inside, such as \"is it morally wrong for 2 consenting siblings to have birth controlled sex?\". The immediate response is yes, but we struggle to come up with a reason. When we are trying to do better on a particular virtue, we feel proud, and award ourselves indulgence credits that we can use.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>normally a chocolate cake would cause us to <em>ick</em> inside if we are on a virtuous path of healthiness, but if we had previously worked out, then this feeling of <em>ick</em> goes away, since we've earned those credits</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Goals should be personal. A bad goal is to \"save money because it is the right thing to do\". \"right thing\" is defined by society, and we don't feel a connection to it. A better goal is \"save money because I want to take next year off and travel the world</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tip: page 96</p>\n<h3 id=\"halo-effect-and-willpower-labels-like-fat-free-organic-free-trade\">Halo effect and willpower Labels like <em>fat free</em>, <em>organic</em>, <em>free trade</em>,<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#halo-effect-and-willpower-labels-like-fat-free-organic-free-trade\"></a></h3>\n<p><em>money saved</em> allow us to overlook potential attributes that are actually\ndetrimental to our goals. </p>\n<p>When this happens, focus on the most consistent measure (ex. Calories, cost,\ntime cost # Dopamine Dopamine is associated with a wanting for\nsomething, not the pleasure that comes with having it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if there was no dopamine, you'd still enjoy sugar.
