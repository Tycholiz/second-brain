Of course, if you take the average of <em>any</em> entire group of one thing, you will get an underwhelming average. (take people for instance: a smaller % of people are considered \"worthwhile to deal with\"). </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Of course if you take all mutual funds and average out their performance, it's going to be underwhelming. But this doesn't take away from the fact that an individual manager can be a skilled investor, and therefore can sell his services as a portfolio manager (ex. mutual fund)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"are-markets-a-self-fulfilling-prophecy\">Are markets a self-fulfilling prophecy?<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#are-markets-a-self-fulfilling-prophecy\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>This statement can only make sense to an extent. In order for a market to be a perfect self-fulfilling prophecy, every investor would have to have exactly the same time horizon. It doesn't make sense otherwise, so at best this statement is only partially true. \n<ul>\n<li>it is true to the extent that people using similar moving averages (50 day vs 200 day) will reach similar conclusions to each other, and will place their stop losses along those same lines. When the stock price crosses this mark, those sellers who used the same technicals will sell their stock. This alone will have a sort of unified \"shock\" to the market that is in a sense a self-fulfilling prophecy, but it centainly does not tell the whole story. Not only are there many more MA periods that people look at, but many investors don't even use those methods to set stop losses, meaning their influence on the market won't reflect the influence of all the people who sold their stock. In the end, the price will be affected, when we are calling the market a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy, we are stretching that term quite a bit.

For a tool like a moving average for instance, we are compelled to use it as a technical tool, since it is so precise, but we can also use it as a fundamental tool in a sense of \"hey, this trend here signals a downturn <em>generally</em> speaking\".
