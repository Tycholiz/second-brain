Instead of: \"Brush your teeth! Get to bed!\", try: \n<ul>\n<li>\"What time is it?\" </li>\n<li>9:00 </li>\n<li>\"And what do we usually do at \"9:00?\" </li>\n<li>brush our teeth \"Well then, are you ready to brush your teeth?\"</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember, when toddlers make you angry, they are not giving you a hard time; they are having a hard time.</p>\n<p>Favor growth, effort praise over intelligence praise</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fixed, intelligence praise- “That’s a really great score; you're so smart”</li>\n<li>growth, effort praise - “That’s a really great score; you must have really worked hard.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\"Our kids do not earn an allowance, but instead earn a commission by doing chores and illustrating good behavior. The kids understand that they lose money by contributing to a complaint jar every time they whine about something before trying to solve the problem first.\"</p>\n<p>Ask \"What did you fail at this week?\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This prompts them to think about what they didn't do well this week, and prompts them to seek for learning opportunities in those failures</li>\n</ul>\n<p>because firstborn children start life as only children, they initially identify with their parents. When a younger sibling arrives, firstborns risk being “dethroned” and often respond by emulating their parents: they enforce rules and assert their authority over the younger sibling, which sets the stage for the younger child to rebel.</p>\n<p>parents of ordinary children had an average of six rules, like specific schedules for homework and bedtime. Parents of highly creative children had an average of less than one rule and tended to “place emphasis on moral values, rather than on specific rules”</p>\n<p>When mothers enforce many rules but offer a clear rationale for why they’re important, teenagers are substantially less likely to break them, because they internalize them.</p>\n<p>\"Please don’t cheat\" they changed the appeal to “Please don’t be a cheater.”</p>\n<p>it's more effective to ask someone \"did you try your hardest?\" than to tell them \"you didn't try your hardest\".</p>\n<p>The ability to visualize is one of the most important things you can foster in someone</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it allows things to come alive. If you can visualize well, a little movie can form in your head, which makes things more vibrant and interesting. This fosters more of an interest in how things work, sparking creativity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"praising-the-process\">Praising the process<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#praising-the-process\"></a></h3>\n<p>Start to marvel at the workings of your child’s mind. Be curious. Wonder about the “how” rather than praising the “what.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. Ask, \"how'd you think to create it like that?\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p><p></p><div class=\"portal-container\">\n<div class=\"portal-head\">\n<div class=\"portal-backlink\">\n<div class=\"portal-title\">From <span class=\"portal-text-title\">Relationships</span></div>\n<a href=\"/notes/het26IMKUnKB7npru8tG4\" class=\"portal-arrow\">Go to text <span class=\"right-arrow\">→</span></a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"portal-parent-anchor\" class=\"portal-parent\" markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"portal-parent-fader-top\"></div>\n<div class=\"portal-parent-fader-bottom\"></div><p><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"block-anchor anchor-heading icon-link\" id=\"^jIdd9KpwWdEcjyCO\" href=\"#^jIdd9KpwWdEcjyCO\"></a>When someone asks us a question that indicates interest in our <em>process</em> we feel that we have that person’s full attention, that there’s nothing this person wants more in that moment than for us to expand and share more about ourselves. </p>\n</div></div><p></p><p></p>\n<p>The parent is in charge of the decision, the child is in charge of his feelings</p>\n<p>When parental arguing is witnesses by a child, it’s not the argument that’s scary to them, as much as it is that no one talks to him about the argument he overheard.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A child cannot feel safe until he understands what’s happening around him. Avoiding talking to a child after an argument means that a child is left to his own devices to understand what happened; this is too much to manage, and a child will resort to self-blame to gain control.</li>\n<li>When we give a child a story to piece things together, a child feels better because he can tell his alert system, “Now that I understand what happened and feel connected to my safe adult, I’m safe.” There are a few key elements to explaining your arguments to your child:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to be an askable parent (ie. a parent who tells their kids \"you can talk to me about anything\"), you have to first model the behaviour by sharing with them. Tell them stories about your day, tell them stories about your past. Keep it mundane, but develop the habit of sharing personal information about yourself so that your child really feels like their is no barrier to be able to feel understood and unjudged.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"fostering-creativity-in-a-child\">Fostering creativity in a child<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#fostering-creativity-in-a-child\"></a></h3>\n<p>The goal for parents shouldn’t just be creating spaces for free thinking, but defining those spaces. Give the kids the heavens, but tether them to Earth.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. Say it’s time for an art project and you’ve provided your kids with paints or colored pencils. Give your kids instructions to draw a sun. Then, excitedly say, “Let’s draw a weird-looking sun with clouds that block it!” or whatever you think is fun and creative. After some time has passed, say, “Let’s share our drawings at the same time!” When that happens, emphasize the originality of the child’s vision. Say, “Look at your sun! Your sun has black and green, unlike the sun in the sky, which is orange and yellow. That’s really great that you’re using your imagination!” By encouraging the kid not be literal, you’re giving the kid a space in which to be creative.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Modeling imagination requires that parents encour</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. If you’re building something out of a plastic toy set, you might make a building out of it, but you can also ask your child, \"what is the strangest building we can possibly make? What would it look like?\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"praise\">Praise<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#praise\"></a></h3>\n<p>To praise a child in a way that inspires behaviour change, it should contain all 3 elements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it is emphatic. Big smile, use of the hands for emphasis. Loud cheery voice.</li>\n<li>it should make mention of the thing that is being praised</li>\n<li>non-verbal praise component, such as a high-five, a tassle of the hair, a hug etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Praising an adolescent (ie. pre-teens and teens) should not be done in an effusive way. Also, the non-verbal praise component should involve no touching (e.g. thumbs up, air high five etc.)</p>\n<p>Also, one should determine which action to praise beforehand. Focus efforts on one or two behaviours to change, and praise freely. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>this makes you more likely to notice these behaviours in your child so are less likely to forget.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Praise should be delivered right after the behaviour occurs</p>\n<p>Give even higher praise for behaviour that did not have to be preceded by a prompt (e.g. when you didn't have to ask your child to get dressed)</p>\n<p>Look for opportunities to mention the good behaviour that had occurred previously</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. \"Wow! You got dressed right when I asked, just like you did yesterday!\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When using praise to shape behaviour, try to praise as many occurrences of the good behaviour that you can</p>\n<p>If a target behaviour doesn't occur often, praise effusively when it does occur. Make a huge deal about it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. \"I cannot believe you did that just like a big boy!\". If someone else is around, bring that person in the room tell the person all about the amazingly excellent behavior that you just saw. As the other adult enters the room, you could say, \"wait till you hear this! Big boy Caleb did exactly as I asked and right away, can you believe it?\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/2023-01-13-21-25-59.png\"></p>\n<p>If the child doesn't co-operate with bigger tasks, get them to do minor things </p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. ask them to come and give you a hug, then praise \"great! you came over when I asked!\"</li>\n<li>ex. if your ultimate goal is to get them to put their dishes in the dishwasher, start off by getting them to bring their cup to the sink and build up from there.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"avoiding-bad-praise\">Avoiding bad praise<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#avoiding-bad-praise\"></a></h4>\n<p>Never connect being a good child with the target behaviour</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. \"John, you're a good boy because you cleaned your room like I asked\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Never connect your love/happiness for the child with the target behaviour</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. \"You make mommy and daddy very happy by cleaning your toys\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Never deliver <em>cabooses</em> to praise</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. \"Thank you so much for cleaning your room. <strong>why can't you always just do it when I ask?</strong>\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Avoid giving out vacuous and non-specific praise, as it will diminish the value of your good-quality praise. The art of delivering praise is just as much about what praise <em>not</em> to give.</p>\n<h3 id=\"when-the-child-just-wont-listen\">When the child just won't listen<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#when-the-child-just-wont-listen\"></a></h3>\n<p>The first step is to try to eliminate the cloud of desperation hovering around the behavior. </p>\n<p>tell the child it is OK if she does not do the desired behavior, or, if it’s essential (bathing, for instance), if she does it superficially and minimally. </p>\n<p>practice nonchalance in talking about the behavior—a shoulder-shrugging, laissez-faire attitude of staged indifference.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. \"Don’t worry about this now; you will be able to do this when you get older,\" a pressure-reducing antecedent that can actually speed up compliance.</li>\n<li>If this relaxation of the pressure leads the child to do the behavior on his own, the parents should maintain their guise of indifference.\n<ul>\n<li>In most contexts, effusive and enthusiastic praise is best, but this situation is different. Here, effusiveness has become associated with stress and implicit pressure, so instead we need some low-key acknowledgement—a simple \"That was good\" augmented by a nonverbal adjunct like a pat on the arm or the back of the head, all low-key and in passing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Offer a choice.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. \"can you put on your red coat or blue coat please?\"</li>\n<li>ex. \"I can help you if you'd like\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"adolescents\">Adolescents<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#adolescents\"></a></h2>\n<p>With a teenager, any effort to control or even influence facets of the adolescence life could be met with resistance and oppositional behavior</p>\n<p>Compromising and Negotating are 2 important tools toward developing your influence over the teenager.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compromise refers to the outcome or actual solution that you reach</li>\n<li>negotiation refers to the process of how to get there.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"compromise\">Compromise<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#compromise\"></a></h3>\n<p>Compromising strengthens your rules in areas where you can't be open to compromise.</p>\n<p>A good rule of thumb is to err toward compromise on things that could be considered phases. Let your child do things that in a manner of 10 years, they would look back and deny that they ever did those things</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. dying hair, dressing goth</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"negotation\">Negotation<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#negotation\"></a></h3>\n<p>The opposite of negotiation would be doling out advice and making decisions without any real input from your teenager.</p>\n<p>listen to what your adolescent says without jumping in, and withold judgements</p>\n<p>Focus on present and not what happened in the past</p>\n<ul>\n<li>even if you are right, being right is jeoporadizing the process of negotiation. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, when it is your turn to talk, provide alternatives and suggestions for how to proceed with the situation. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide a number of options of how to proceed, that might include two or three possible solutions. </li>\n<li>present them in a way that is not authoritative. \n<ul>\n<li>So try not to say anything like, \"Here's what you should do\" or \"this is what needs to happen\". Rather, leave with a sentence like, \"Here are some alternatives we might talk about\" or \"have you considered this or that?\" </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>the adolescent is much more likely to agree to one of your options or generate a compromise based on how you present the possible options and whether choices were involved.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Elements of effective negotation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>select a time where there is no tension and no decision has to be reached at a particular moment.</li>\n<li>listen without jumping in. Be respectful of the teenager. Focus on the present and completely avoid bringing up what the teenager may have done in the past. </li>\n<li>Stay on topic</li>\n<li>offer possible suggestions when there is a disagreement.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Remember to praise when the child exhibits the good behaviour as a result of the negotiation</p>\n<h4 id=\"initiating-the-negotation\">Initiating the negotation<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#initiating-the-negotation\"></a></h4>\n<p>Don't be abrupt in bringing up the subject</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. \"Can we talk about the cell phone problem?\"\n<ul>\n<li>bring it up in this way means \"I want to talk about something, and this is a problem\"</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Begin with the mindset, \"Here is why I need your help. I would like to reach a solution we can both live with regarding your cell phone use. You have one view, I have another. Let us find something we both might be able to live with and to do together. I know you want to use your cell phone all the time. It is important for me to understand more about this. Tell me how you see this.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>after listening thoughtfully to them, say something like \"Here's my view. And let me say this even though you probably know what it is.\"\n<ul>\n<li>Here to the tone of how and what you say are even more important than the content to keep the negotiation going.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whatever you decide, this is a trial period, maybe for a week, and then you come together to see how it is going. This gives you and your teen a way out if some part of it is not working, or if there is some tinkering that needs to be done.</p>\n<h3 id=\"problem-solving\">Problem-solving<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#problem-solving\"></a></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>state the problem\n<ul>\n<li>ex. You might say, \"So Jack, is picking on you at recess.\" </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>prompt and encourage the identification of potential strategies or solutions. \n<ul>\n<li>ex. So you say, \"What are some of the things you might do to handle that?\"</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>identify two or three possible ways of handling the situation or general approaches to the problem\n<ul>\n<li>if your adolescent can take the lead on one of these that is better. We want to get them involved in the decision making process. It is imoprtant to not judge their strategy at this time.</li>\n<li>ex. you might say, \"Well, one thing we could do would be to talk to the teacher. Is there something else we could do?\"</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>go through each possible solution one at a time to identify what the consequences would be\n<ul>\n<li>ex. You say, \"Okay, one strategy is to go to the teacher. If you went to the teacher what would happen?\", and then prompt the same for the next strategy</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>choose one of the solutions that is the best of the solutions based on the different consequences.\n<ul>\n<li>ex. You say, \"Okay, which seems to be the best solution?\"</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>simulate\n<ul>\n<li>Try to make this fun and light.</li>\n<li>ex. you and your teen actually role play the best solution. You as a parent play the bully and your child pretends to be himself in the situation and he acts out the best solution. Then you switch roles.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"abcs-antecedents-behaviour-consequences\">ABCs: Antecedents, Behaviour, Consequences<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#abcs-antecedents-behaviour-consequences\"></a></h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/everyday-parenting\">source</a>\nAll 3 are critical components to changing behaviour</li>\n</ul>\n<p>note: the techniques described are tools that must be used together.

This is precisely why the first element of many of the tools is to \"define the behaviour you want to change beforehand\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The tools described showcase examples that are fit for school-age children and younger, but the concepts apply equally well to a person of any age (including adolescents, and even adults).

Consider that when 2 children are playing together nicely, we tend to leave them alone.

Even if you are successful 90% of the time ignoring the behaviour, it will be that 10% probability that the child will be motivated by, and the behaviour will persist.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>this same effect is present in gambing psychology, where when a reward occurs once in a while and is unpredictable, behaviour can persist for a long time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Behaviours tend to get worse when starting a planned ignoring routine.

However, the emphasis has to be on the <em>positive opposite</em>.</p>\n<p>Steps to effective punishment:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>decide the behavior you want to decrease.</li>\n<li>decide the behavior you would like to replace that other behavior (ie. <em>positive opposite</em>) so that you can attend to and praise it.</li>\n<li>decide how you will reward that new behaviour</li>\n<li>decide on the punishment that will be used. It should be mild and brief, since more intense punishments have shown to be no more effective, and also bring out more negative side-effects.\n<ul>\n<li>the punishment should be determined ahead of time to avoid impromptu punishments, since impromptu punishments tend to be long and severe</li>\n<li>ex. time out from reinforcement, loss of a privilege for a short period of time, loss of points if you're using a point program, or even a mild reprimand.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>make sure instances of the praise greatly outnumber the instances of the punishment.\n<ul>\n<li>ex. if you gave your child time out four times this week, it would be critical to administer attention for the <em>positive opposite</em> at least twice as many times.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Three main types of punishment</p>\n<ol>\n<li>presenting something undesirable or negative after a behavior. In each case, the child does the undesirable behavior and something is presented.\n<ul>\n<li>ex. reprimands, shouting, or hitting a child. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>taking away something positive after a behavior. \n<ul>\n<li>ex. taking away an activity, a privilege, or some planned positive event, give time out. In point programs, taking points away for some misbehavior would be another example</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>requiring some effort or some task that has to be performed. This usually consists of using a chore or cleaning up something as a penalty. \n<ul>\n<li>ex. if a child breaks something, he would have to clean up the mess as the penalty or work on some other chore.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Traditional punishment is not very effective for developing behaviours, nor eliminating negative behaviours.</p>\n<p>Negative side-effects of punishment</p>\n<ol>\n<li>emotional reactions on the part of the child who is punished. This may include crying, arguing, or even striking a parent.</li>\n<li>escape and avoidance. When a parent delivers more punishment than praise, children often try to distance themselves from the person who punished them. \n<ul>\n<li>Consider that the punishment you give may be creating a negative association that we want to avoid.\n<ul>\n<li>ex. when punishment consists of extra homework, staying after school, and even exercising, that creates a negative association for the child. This is something we must be careful to avoid.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>an increase in aggressive behavior. When a person punishes, the child is more likely to retaliate by hitting the punisher. This is especially likely when the punishment involves physical contact in some way.\n<ul>\n<li>ex. if a parent uses hitting as a form of punishment, that'll lead to aggression and teach them to punish their peers in the same way.</li>\n<li>ex. if the parent tries to physically force or take a child to time out</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"timeout-from-reinforcement\">Timeout from Reinforcement<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#timeout-from-reinforcement\"></a></h4>\n<p>Time out consists of a brief period of time in which the child does not have access to the usual rewards in the situation</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. the rewards might be just being in the presence of others, receiving parent, teacher or peer attention, or participating in some activity or game that is going on</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During time out, there is no talking or playing with the child.</p>\n<p>The place of timeout must not be somewhere where the child can not have fun or find interesting things.</p>\n<p>Timeouts have nothing to do with thinking about what they did wrong— they are about withdrawing attention for a period of time.</p>\n<p>It is not necessary to send the child to their room; even having them stay in the same room that the negative behaviour occurred in is fine</p>\n<p>\"reinforcement\" is a technical term for <em>rewards</em></p>\n<p>There are five ingredients for using time out. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>decide exactly what behavior will serve as the basis for asking the child to go to time out.</li>\n<li>determine the <em>positive opposite</em> behaviours, and praise when they occur\n<ul>\n<li>without this, positive behaviour change will not occur</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>decide what and where this timeout will occur.</li>\n<li>decide how long timeout will last (1-5 minutes is sufficient)\n<ul>\n<li>longer tiemouts are not more effective</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>have a backup punishing event (preferably loss of privilege) that will be used if the child refuses to go to timeout.\n<ul>\n<li>the punishment should not exceed 24 hours</li>\n<li>ex. \"if you do not go to timeout now, you will lose your tv privilege for tonight.

Here you'll find thoughts, lessons, facts and any other interesting musings that I've come across or thought up over the years. A lot of what I have gathered over the years are originally from the minds of others, while some are my own. Some may be outdated and no longer reflect my current views. Some may contain misinformation, though I try to be rigorous with my additions. You can think of it as my personal wiki.\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [Tech-focused Digital Garden](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com)\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the Second Brain, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/thoughts-on","name":"thoughts-on"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The non-Tech Second Brain of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"thoughts.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://thoughts.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["thoughts-on"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
