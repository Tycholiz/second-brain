You day trade and swing trade different type of stocks. To hold onto the stock overnight would betray the strategy, and you would all of a sudden be playing a different ballgame.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The strength of day trading strategies is that other day traders are also trading the stock. Therefore, you should not be trading stocks that other day traders are not aware of.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The more traders using these strategies, the better they will work\n<ul>\n<li>This is why many traders are happy to share their day trading strategies</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>join a community of traders, such as those found on Twitter or StockTwits</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Profitable traders usually make only two or three trades each day.</p>\n<p>Penny stocks should be avoided, as they are extremely manipulated and they do not follow any of the rules of the standard strategies</p>\n<p>Successful trading depends on a high amount of trade volume (liquidity) so as to be able to easily close out/buy shares.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>there is typically much higher volume in the morning than in afternoon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your broker will buy and sell stocks for you at the Exchange. Your only job as a day trader is to manage risk.</p>\n<p>Many traders think a good trading day is a positive day. Wrong. A good trading day is a day that you were disciplined, traded sound strategies and did not violate any trading rules. The normal uncertainty of the stock market will result in some of your days being negative, but that does not mean that a negative day was a bad trading day.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stocks-in-play\">Stocks in play<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#stocks-in-play\"></a></h3>\n<p><em>Stocks in play</em> are the stocks that don't follow the overall trajectory of the market. They do this because there is some catalyst that causes them to perform distinctly independently of the market.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>this small handful of stocks that are going to be running when the markets are tanking, or tanking when the markets are running.</li>\n<li>If these stocks move with the market, that's fine too— you just want to ensure that there is some fundamental reason that it is moving, and not just tracing the overall stock market.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Stocks in play</em> are the stocks that day traders are looking to trade.</p>\n<p>Stocks in play generally have some fresh news (positive/negative) that causes them to move, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Earnings reports</li>\n<li>Earnings warnings/pre-announcements</li>\n<li>Earnings surprises</li>\n<li>FDA approvals/disapprovals</li>\n<li>Mergers/acquisitions</li>\n<li>Alliances/partnerships/major product releases</li>\n<li>Major contract wins/losses</li>\n<li>Restructurings/layoffs/management changes</li>\n<li>Stock splits/buybacks/debt offerings</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"institutions-vs-individual-traders\">Institutions vs individual traders<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#institutions-vs-individual-traders\"></a></h3>\n<p>Rarely is any human involved in the day trading operations of the large accounts of investment banks, proprietary trading firms (called prop traders), mutual funds and hedge funds.</p>\n<p>The Achilles’ heel of most institutional traders is that they must trade, while individual traders are free to trade or to stay out of the market</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This means that to be a successful individual trader, you must learn when <em>not</em> to trade.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If an individual is trading in lots of 100 shares, then an institution is trading in lots of 1,000,000; which takes plenty of time to unload. Unloading 100 shares is a lot quicker, and allows you to play the day-trading game a lot more guerilla-like.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This means that institutions get burned harder for losses than individuals do.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is extremely important to stay away from stocks that are being heavily traded by institutional traders</p>\n<p>The absolute maximum a trader should risk on any trade is 2% of their account equity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"principles\">Principles<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#principles\"></a></h2>\n<h4 id=\"always-stick-to-your-strategy\">Always stick to your strategy<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#always-stick-to-your-strategy\"></a></h4>\n<p>Holding a position that is trading against you because you are primarily interested in proving your prediction to be correct is bad trading.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you have to be careful of justifying your continued ownership of a stock.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"keep-focus-on-profit-loss-ratio\">Keep focus on profit-loss ratio<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#keep-focus-on-profit-loss-ratio\"></a></h4>\n<p>A good setup is an opportunity for you to get into a trade with as little risk as possible. That means you might be risking $100, but you have the potential to make $300. You would call that a 3 to 1 profit-to-loss ratio. On the other hand, if you get into a setup where you're risking $100 to make $10, you have a less than 1 risk/reward ratio, and that's going to be a trade that you should not take.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A 2:1 win:loss ratio is a realistic minimum to have, meaning if you have to risk $100, then you are expecting no less than a $200 return.\n<ul>\n<li>That means if you buy $1,000 worth of stock, and are risking $100 on it, you must sell it for at least $1,20; if the price comes down to $900, you must accept the loss</li>\n<li>with a 2:1 win:loss ratio, you can be wrong 40% of the time and still make money.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"timing-is-everything\">Timing is everything<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#timing-is-everything\"></a></h4>\n<p>You're setting your stop loss in accordance with your profit-loss ratio, but what happens if you miss an opportunity to buy, and bought the stock anyway (say, 3 min past the point of your planned strategy)? At this point, all your calculations that went into determining if this was a good trade or not are out the window. Because you have now provided different variables than anticipated to the function, you will get a far less favorable return than you expected</p>\n<hr>\n<strong>Children</strong>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/YmOx2omzGdQneVNXpDpwy\">Stock Picking</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/GuE52LjvxKbCBZIgj7N76\">Strategies</a></li>\n</ol>","noteIndex":{"id":"8qvi4S0Dk1BAaCLhfHqAp","title":"Second Brain","desc":"","updated":1672111562730,"created":1616360437888,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"../main/thoughts-on","name":"thoughts-on"},"contentHash":"dd394dade3f08feaa5cf4d1caeb1c991","links":[],"anchors":{"tags":{"type":"header","text":"Tags","value":"tags","line":12,"column":0,"depth":3}},"children":["8aPvLrwcPnxcTwx7PdvXW","l9ldUruxqRBZwMij5KlS5","xWh3SS0J1hvRSZ7g4LvEE","cc5kdn5ay8omhcud9hjfpyk","9jNuGCXVuFaZOGZfLpKi5","mhlpKRrfT0qlXzTaapFYZ","QU1tbQ4KX64UBCWtCxAcR","U4tQLU5tRHqr9e7H3G4Gm","PvcIkEJcDtcv7luF2mBIU","2wW5Kxk794H9mfnu9VPA8","iwANjkbi3nbIovlVpepWm","XYgvsgvjzgoyvY6KAEu5Y","pT9wnWnS42pFId9UIH5he","gmXZ6Xy8f8FFQ66Z5DYqh","CjV6QXVHIqQTuZTSlSSlB","IgbLitAU1k0ioGhuvmjjS","D42jFbx0vNlT7S6QRb5ee","dFs5zopMmrh3rPgQaSkyP","W0AgEfoTzJ8VxVE4QqhSL","ggU4P3K1OhUlHBJbpgHiD","vtu2srTzCfoNUHv0Xcbxn","6kuwlrc3PT5JoQS9xZWZW","qoZ6e9KsYPestYFpO4Ce4","GPH8BieqB4dtqul80gJvX","MbW1wF5mIZ7g3DPXrOSyZ","Ay9vOAmvV8ODJFpaEkw6J","8Pi3wPs4LTxlAEOUE48Te","SDd8268l79j2cnvCVVl8F","zI5rK8mFkNghzLgbQD6ox","zCwMY5ckgKAqstOhw2Drd","i5Fya3Vzzm0rBT0ctByuo","YDbL8QXchj03NvTIZOdrk","km4fy13hx9puopyjr1ajdgj","WdAyuDkIi16pl1pnaopzx","15ax6k6x106sotobkyn3jqp","sgu2QxqDGup93hJPx8RJd","mT663nw5DUEaEGzXI98yD","Dyg6bFtxE0UkB7gz6pqzq","cn1x9vhdapyt1fvgtvfekea","0aYhvzCfaIxLaNhqNCV9Q","q9NskCGxFGNQwBDcsgNkY","wAdoBPUMHEFJkm6XVlHXW","sCYBuXnSNA259MDwhakmv","YgQusR9D6RbBgdkLuJuDh","ovHaNSb3tnl2LTdV7wwau","eqklm05q2g46ikqaqv9ijh9","8TJC5FfwKtfmH4GfOZVoO","9rKIOn3BV7ZU1FFlJxmvC","rsrE9vBXK0ehNkbEjltlZ","XTkKLi0Jg1imZ2lbhgOrv","4Fuw6OHQ5uhEVCUfXDfkb","pUEyedPYYlNSVLuiUSnge","KtoCw0HFEddGJ7GuW7GnN","BoxZ36iWEbUoRProxPo4D","gCmclfAHAt1tEcFDc24eD","TNhxyx7GEdGDM0PBI08b1","guyW7WWQNDGDALFV7tO57","YeEWZtb7FWvYTyJwF7zhR","DUrXQvolf76ILMKJm4Zt6","Jo4jAQcwgxsdxkcxUceR4","X6yPFUKIjs6tENQ3uNzE2","aRSv8qoJLyeE6xDAAUYpU","jwb0toyj23byc7krttp0l8k","ztqrUgUYssC0FAWDGZxWF","d7evrjgli013nul3mosquea","mvBLIZW424WZ5mCmjKQaB","YoV6c5CmpHYNEuYU4PsgH","JQzF2iPfQ2897j6HFCoY9","TicwTJD2oaTpncpPy93s2","KiGGs6PmvIlIt50r2tF2O","4TiqSFRd4hD0e5tyHbf4d","8F9H6GIButHtrFKXHzZFu","t5CaAEDQFRutGrV0ru97d","het26IMKUnKB7npru8tG4","GgRKYXklrXEAs9u15sOM9","PPvKHQNulUEvXEitqAZxM","SMGOfSTElTkJBezhNvkZ6","358nLIVsR9zmItfuBCWq2","xewZxeuhzI7qMvoYdcnLM","FAAtgk8cbuownxuv0Vlou","64N1mdh3JWL1WOv1dilYD","aCd3q2zSzgQnHKi1vOJFj","kh7Y1bQw7Om31yurE4CrW","5162x506d5mgwkn07plcuo3","LGnyEtwA1LlztJJwEpg6l","zoJRWH59vBCpqnm8fOpis","xlg9pngfxviby5z2qfcfpcv","G6zDrHf3Ua8R7vllalBc5","NrjfBxxDU92ByYSIJjgDM","zNcMG5nj1t69zkAFnvn5S","JIHQPGBUDqAEPzbhfFxlc","MmjHaByLtYx5sv2HzXnWd"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nWelcome to my Second Brain!
