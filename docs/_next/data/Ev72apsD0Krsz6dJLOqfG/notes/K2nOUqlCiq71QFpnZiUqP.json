It's almost like the spotlight has been shone on that one event, so everyone's attention is on it.it is at this point that humans go into analysis mode, and look for explanations as to why something happened, and try to explain why or why not something else will happen in the future</p>\n<h3 id=\"timescale-of-black-swans\">Timescale of Black Swans<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#timescale-of-black-swans\"></a></h3>\n<p>Black swan events happen over varying durations. earthquakes last minutes, 911 lasted hours, technological implementations may take decades, but they are no less Black swan events</p>\n<p>in general positive Black swan events take time to show their effect, while negative ones happen very quickly (it is much easier and quicker to destroy than it is to build)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>humans tend to \"tunnel\", that is, focus on a few well-defined sources of uncertainty, on two specific a list of black swans (at the expense of others that do not easily come to mind)</p>\n<p>Narrative fallacy and confirmation bias are internal mechanisms causing blindness to black swans.</p>\n<p>We learn from repetition at the expense of events that have not happened before</p>\n<ul>\n<li>events that are nonrepeatable (eg 9/11) are ignored before their occurrence, and overestimated afterward</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our misunderstanding of the black swan can be attributed to system 1 (a focus on narratives and the sensational), which imposes on us a wrong map of the likelihood of events</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The sources of Black Swans have multiplied far above levels in the past</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in the past it was just: newly encountered wild animals, new enemies, and abrupt weather changes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A set of conclusions is potentially undone once any of its fundamental postulates is disproved. In this case, the observation of a single black swan would be the undoing of the logic of any system of thought, as well as any reasoning that followed from that underlying logic.</p>\n<p>First, it is an outlier, as it lies outside the realm of regular expectations, because nothing in the past can convincingly point to its possibility. Second, it carries an extreme 'impact'.
