Instead, <code>x</code> can only become arbitrarily small (meaning we can continue to get smaller and smaller, but never <code>0</code>). From the other side, we can make <code>x</code> an arbitrarily large number (meaning we can continue to get bigger, but never infinite).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>So the graph would start <code>f(x)</code> at almost infinity and end at almost 0, but never becoming 0, being a giant L shape</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"driving-analogy\">Driving analogy<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#driving-analogy\"></a></h3>\n<p>Say you're travelling 100 km.
