In other words, it describes how a sound changes over time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>there are various types of envelope\n<ul>\n<li>ex. an amplitude envelope describes how the amplitude of a sound changes over time\n<ul>\n<li>amp envelopes are most common, particularly when talking about acoustic (ie. non-digital) sounds</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>consider the plucking of a guitar string. As we hit the string, the sound reaches its absolute peak.</p>\n<p>Instruments don't make sounds the way lamps make light: it's not \"all\" or \"nothing.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>instead, the sound wave is composed of 4 sections:\n<img src=\"/assets/images/2023-03-05-16-24-02.png\"></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"adsr\">ADSR<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#adsr\"></a></h2>\n<p>The combination of ADSR describe how a sound changes over time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"attack\">Attack<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#attack\"></a></h3>\n<p>The attack controls the time taken for the sound to reach its peak from nil.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in the case of an amplitude envelope, it is the part of the envelope where amplitude is still increasing. \n<ul>\n<li>In other words, it is the time taken for amplitude to reach max level.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most natural instruments have a very short attack, meaning they reach max amplitude very quickly.</p>\n<p>A slow attack can be perceived as a sort of fade-inâ€” as we press the key down, it takes a more significant amount of time before the sound reaches its peak amplitude.</p>\n<h3 id=\"decay\">Decay<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#decay\"></a></h3>\n<p>The decay controls the time taken for the envelope to decrease from its peak to the sustain level. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>in the case of an amplitude envelope, the part where amplitude starts to decrease. This phase starts as soon as the attack phase reaches its peak.</li>\n<li>in real spaces high frequencies often decay quite fast while bass frequencies stick around much longer. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"sustain\">Sustain<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#sustain\"></a></h3>\n<p>the period during which amplitude remains constant</p>\n<ul>\n<li>many natural instruments (e.g. guitar) don't have a sustain phase</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While attack, decay, and release refer to a length of time, sustain refers to level (e.g. in case of amp envelope, a volume level).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>often, sustain is quantified by a % of the peak value\n<ul>\n<li>ex. with an amplitude envelope, a sustain of 70% means that the sustain phase of the envelope is at 70% of the amplitude of the peak's amplitude value.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"release\">Release<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#release\"></a></h3>\n<p>the final reduction in amplitude.</p>\n<p>On piano, this would be the time it takes for the sound to reach 0 amplitude after we take our finger off the key.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"example-envelopes-of-different-instruments\">Example: envelopes of different instruments<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#example-envelopes-of-different-instruments\"></a></h3>\n<p>ex. If you press a piano key and release it, the sound changes volume gradually over time. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>First, it rises quickly (or \"attacks\") to its maximum volume. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Next, the sound \"decays\" to a lower level and stays there or \"sustains.\" </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, when we let go of the key, the sound \"releases\" and dies down to silence. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In a piano, the attack phase is fairly slow and the sustain phase can be really long as the notes take a long time to die away. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ex. With a flute, the attack phase is quicker and sharper, there is little decay, the sustain continues for as long as the flautist keeps blowing, and the release is also very fast.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ex. With the strike of a drum, you have an almost instant attack, a longer decay (depending on what material you're hitting), and effectively no sustain or release.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/xqivfo0puz9qmo84tyvvcjt\">Synthesize</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"8qvi4S0Dk1BAaCLhfHqAp","title":"Second Brain","desc":"","updated":1672111562730,"created":1616360437888,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"../main/thoughts-on","name":"thoughts-on"},"contentHash":"dd394dade3f08feaa5cf4d1caeb1c991","links":[],"anchors":{"tags":{"type":"header","text":"Tags","value":"tags","line":12,"column":0,"depth":3}},"children":["8aPvLrwcPnxcTwx7PdvXW","l9ldUruxqRBZwMij5KlS5","xWh3SS0J1hvRSZ7g4LvEE","cc5kdn5ay8omhcud9hjfpyk","9jNuGCXVuFaZOGZfLpKi5","mhlpKRrfT0qlXzTaapFYZ","QU1tbQ4KX64UBCWtCxAcR","U4tQLU5tRHqr9e7H3G4Gm","PvcIkEJcDtcv7luF2mBIU","2wW5Kxk794H9mfnu9VPA8","iwANjkbi3nbIovlVpepWm","XYgvsgvjzgoyvY6KAEu5Y","pT9wnWnS42pFId9UIH5he","gmXZ6Xy8f8FFQ66Z5DYqh","CjV6QXVHIqQTuZTSlSSlB","IgbLitAU1k0ioGhuvmjjS","D42jFbx0vNlT7S6QRb5ee","dFs5zopMmrh3rPgQaSkyP","W0AgEfoTzJ8VxVE4QqhSL","ggU4P3K1OhUlHBJbpgHiD","vtu2srTzCfoNUHv0Xcbxn","6kuwlrc3PT5JoQS9xZWZW","qoZ6e9KsYPestYFpO4Ce4","GPH8BieqB4dtqul80gJvX","MbW1wF5mIZ7g3DPXrOSyZ","Ay9vOAmvV8ODJFpaEkw6J","8Pi3wPs4LTxlAEOUE48Te","SDd8268l79j2cnvCVVl8F","zI5rK8mFkNghzLgbQD6ox","zCwMY5ckgKAqstOhw2Drd","i5Fya3Vzzm0rBT0ctByuo","YDbL8QXchj03NvTIZOdrk","km4fy13hx9puopyjr1ajdgj","WdAyuDkIi16pl1pnaopzx","15ax6k6x106sotobkyn3jqp","sgu2QxqDGup93hJPx8RJd","mT663nw5DUEaEGzXI98yD","Dyg6bFtxE0UkB7gz6pqzq","cn1x9vhdapyt1fvgtvfekea","0aYhvzCfaIxLaNhqNCV9Q","q9NskCGxFGNQwBDcsgNkY","wAdoBPUMHEFJkm6XVlHXW","sCYBuXnSNA259MDwhakmv","YgQusR9D6RbBgdkLuJuDh","ovHaNSb3tnl2LTdV7wwau","eqklm05q2g46ikqaqv9ijh9","8TJC5FfwKtfmH4GfOZVoO","9rKIOn3BV7ZU1FFlJxmvC","rsrE9vBXK0ehNkbEjltlZ","XTkKLi0Jg1imZ2lbhgOrv","4Fuw6OHQ5uhEVCUfXDfkb","pUEyedPYYlNSVLuiUSnge","KtoCw0HFEddGJ7GuW7GnN","BoxZ36iWEbUoRProxPo4D","gCmclfAHAt1tEcFDc24eD","TNhxyx7GEdGDM0PBI08b1","guyW7WWQNDGDALFV7tO57","YeEWZtb7FWvYTyJwF7zhR","DUrXQvolf76ILMKJm4Zt6","Jo4jAQcwgxsdxkcxUceR4","X6yPFUKIjs6tENQ3uNzE2","aRSv8qoJLyeE6xDAAUYpU","jwb0toyj23byc7krttp0l8k","ztqrUgUYssC0FAWDGZxWF","d7evrjgli013nul3mosquea","mvBLIZW424WZ5mCmjKQaB","YoV6c5CmpHYNEuYU4PsgH","JQzF2iPfQ2897j6HFCoY9","TicwTJD2oaTpncpPy93s2","KiGGs6PmvIlIt50r2tF2O","4TiqSFRd4hD0e5tyHbf4d","8F9H6GIButHtrFKXHzZFu","t5CaAEDQFRutGrV0ru97d","het26IMKUnKB7npru8tG4","GgRKYXklrXEAs9u15sOM9","PPvKHQNulUEvXEitqAZxM","SMGOfSTElTkJBezhNvkZ6","358nLIVsR9zmItfuBCWq2","xewZxeuhzI7qMvoYdcnLM","FAAtgk8cbuownxuv0Vlou","64N1mdh3JWL1WOv1dilYD","aCd3q2zSzgQnHKi1vOJFj","kh7Y1bQw7Om31yurE4CrW","5162x506d5mgwkn07plcuo3","LGnyEtwA1LlztJJwEpg6l","zoJRWH59vBCpqnm8fOpis","xlg9pngfxviby5z2qfcfpcv","G6zDrHf3Ua8R7vllalBc5","NrjfBxxDU92ByYSIJjgDM","zNcMG5nj1t69zkAFnvn5S","JIHQPGBUDqAEPzbhfFxlc","MmjHaByLtYx5sv2HzXnWd"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nWelcome to my Second Brain!
