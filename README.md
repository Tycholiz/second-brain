# Dendron Second Brain
This repo represents the publicly deployed Dendron vault `thoughts-on`.

All of the magic in this repo is in
`.github/workflows/deploy-dendron-nextjs.yml`, which deploys the generated
nextjs site to gh-pages via the `pages` branch. Therefore, if you want to see
the generated html, see the `docs/` directory in that branch.
